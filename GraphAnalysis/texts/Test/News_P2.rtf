De Blasio said he expects that over time the weekly testing will become "tiresome," and employees will opt to get vaccinated. He is now pushing for the private health care industry to impose a similar mandate.\
\
"We need to get serious more than ever about vaccination," he said Friday. "If everyone was vaccinated right now we would not be having a conversation about the delta variant. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated."\
\
A number of New York City businesses have already initiated a vaccine mandate, including some Wall Street corporations. BlackRock Inc. is only allowing fully vaccinated employees to return, and Morgan Stanley is requiring employees and visitors of their New York City offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19.}
