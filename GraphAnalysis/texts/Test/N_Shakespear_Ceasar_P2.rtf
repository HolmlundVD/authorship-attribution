But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;\
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine\
How to cut off some charge in legacies.\

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 This is a slight unmeritable man,\
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,\
The three-fold world divided, he should stand\
One of the three to share it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 So you thought him;\
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,\
In our black sentence and proscription.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Octavius, I have seen more days than you:\
And though we lay these honours on this man,\
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,\
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,\
To groan and sweat under the business,\
Either led or driven, as we point the way;\
And having brought our treasure where we will,\
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,\
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,\
And graze in commons.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 You may do your will;\
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 So is my horse, Octavius; and for that\
I do appoint him store of provender:\
It is a creature that I teach to fight,\
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,\
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.\
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;\
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;\
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds\
On abjects, orts and imitations,\
Which, out of use and staled by other men,\
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,\
But as a property. And now, Octavius,\
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius\
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:\
Therefore let our alliance be combined,\
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd\
And let us presently go sit in council,\
How covert matters may be best disclosed,\
And open perils surest answered.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Let us do so: for we are at the stake,\
And bay'd about with many enemies;\
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,\
Millions of mischiefs.\

\f0\b0 \cf2 He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,\
In his own change, or by ill officers,\
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish\
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,\
I shall be satisfied.\

As he hath used of old.\

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Thou hast described\
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,\
When love begins to sicken and decay,\
It useth an enforced ceremony.\
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;\
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,\
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;\
But when they should endure the bloody spur,\
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,\
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?\

That struck the foremost man of all this world\
But for supporting robbers, shall we now\
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,\
And sell the mighty space of our large honours\
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?\

And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?\
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch\
Under your testy humour? By the gods\
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,\
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.\

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.\

\f0\b0 \cf2 I durst not!\

\f0\b0 \cf2 For your life you durst not!\

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Do not presume too much upon my love;\
I may do that I shall be sorry for.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 You have done that you should be sorry for.\
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,\
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty\
That they pass by me as the idle wind,\
Which I respect not. I did send to you\
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:\
For I can raise no money by vile means:\
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,\
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring\
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\
By any indirection: I did send\
To you for gold to pay my legions,\
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?\
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?\
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,\
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,\
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;\
Dash him to pieces!\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I denied you not.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 You did.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I did not: he was but a fool that brought\
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:\
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,\
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I do not, till you practise them on me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 You love me not.\

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I do not like your faults.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 A friendly eye could never see such faults.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 A flatterer's would not, though they do appear\
As huge as high Olympus.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\
For Cassius is aweary of the world;\
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;\
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,\
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,\
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep\
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\
And here my naked breast; within, a heart\
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:\
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;\
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:\
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,\
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Sheathe your dagger:\
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;\
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.\
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb\
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;\
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\
And straight is cold again.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Hath Cassius lived\
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\

Makes me forgetful?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,\
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,\
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.\

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Impatient of my absence,\
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony\
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death\
That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,\
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\

\cf2 Welcome, good Messala.\
Now sit we close about this taper here,\
And call in question our necessities.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Portia, art thou gone?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 No more, I pray you.\
Messala, I have here received letters,\
That young Octavius and Mark Antony\
Come down upon us with a mighty power,\
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 With what addition?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 That by proscription and bills of outlawry,\
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,\
Have put to death an hundred senators.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Therein our letters do not well agree;\
Mine speak of seventy senators that died\
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Cicero one!\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Cicero is dead,\
And by that order of proscription.\
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 No, Messala.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Nothing, Messala.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 That, methinks, is strange.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 No, my lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:\
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:\
With meditating that she must die once,\
I have the patience to endure it now.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Even so great men great losses should endure.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I have as much of this in art as you,\
But yet my nature could not bear it so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Well, to our work alive. What do you think\
Of marching to Philippi presently?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I do not think it good.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Your reason?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 This it is:\
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:\
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,\
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,\
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.\
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground\
Do stand but in a forced affection;\
For they have grudged us contribution:\
The enemy, marching along by them,\
By them shall make a fuller number up,\
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;\
From which advantage shall we cut him off,\
If at Philippi we do face him there,\
These people at our back.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Hear me, good brother.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Under your pardon. You must note beside,\
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,\
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:\
The enemy increaseth every day;\
We, at the height, are ready to decline.\
There is a tide in the affairs of men,\
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\
Omitted, all the voyage of their life\
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\
On such a full sea are we now afloat;\
And we must take the current when it serves,\
Or lose our ventures.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Then, with your will, go on;\
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 The deep of night is crept upon our talk,\
And nature must obey necessity;\
Which we will niggard with a little rest.\
There is no more to say?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,\
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;\
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:\
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;\
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.\
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down\
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.\

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:\
You said the enemy would not come down,\
But keep the hills and upper regions;\
It proves not so: their battles are at hand;\
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,\
Answering before we do demand of them.\

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know\
Wherefore they do it: they could be content\
To visit other places; and come down\
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face\
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;\
But 'tis not so.\

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.\
Make forth; the generals would have some words.\

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Not that we love words better, as you do.\

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:\
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,\
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Antony,\
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;\
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,\
And leave them honeyless.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Not stingless too.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 O, yes, and soundless too;\
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,\
And very wisely threat before you sting.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers\
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:\
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,\
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;\
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind\
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:\
This tongue had not offended so to-day,\
If Cassius might have ruled.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,\
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;\
I draw a sword against conspirators;\
When think you that the sword goes up again?\
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds\
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar\
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,\
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 So I hope;\
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.\

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,\
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Messala,\
This is my birth-day; as this very day\
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:\
Be thou my witness that against my will,\
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set\
Upon one battle all our liberties.\
You know that I held Epicurus strong\
And his opinion: now I change my mind,\
And partly credit things that do presage.\
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign\
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,\
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;\
Who to Philippi here consorted us:\
This morning are they fled away and gone;\
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,\
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,\
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem\
A canopy most fatal, under which\
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Believe not so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I but believe it partly;\
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved\
To meet all perils very constantly.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Even so, Lucilius.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Now, most noble Brutus,\
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,\
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!\
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,\
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.\
If we do lose this battle, then is this\
The very last time we shall speak together:\
What are you then determined to do?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Even by the rule of that philosophy\
By which I did blame Cato for the death\
Which he did give himself, I know not how,\
But I do find it cowardly and vile,\
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent\
The time of life: arming myself with patience\
To stay the providence of some high powers\
That govern us below.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Then, if we lose this battle,\
You are contented to be led in triumph\
Thorough the streets of Rome?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,\
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;\
He bears too great a mind. But this same day\
Must end that work the ides of March begun;\
And whether we shall meet again I know not.\
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:\
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!\
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;\
If not, why then, this parting was well made.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 CASSIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 BRUTUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know\
The end of this day's business ere it come!\

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 What man is that?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 STRATO\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:\
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;\
For Brutus only overcame himself,\
And no man else hath honour by his death.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 LUCILIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,\
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.\
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 STRATO\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Do so, good Messala.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 How died my master, Strato?\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 STRATO\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 I held the sword, and he did run on it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 MESSALA\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 Octavius, then take him to follow thee,\
That did the latest service to my master.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 ANTONY\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 This was the noblest Roman of them all:\
All the conspirators save only he\
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;\
He only, in a general honest thought\
And common good to all, made one of them.\
His life was gentle, and the elements\
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up\
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf2 OCTAVIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 According to his virtue let us use him,\
With all respect and rites of burial.\
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,\
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.\
So call the field to rest; and let's away,\
To part the glories of this happy day.\
