Roquentin's way out of his predicament is not given in detail, but in his remarks about the jazz recording and about his own plans for future literary endeavors, he seems to indicate that he knows a means of survival. It is unfortunate that Sartre chose to call by the name of \"jazz\" a recording that, from Roquentin's description of it, most musically minded Americans will recognize as commercial pseudo-jazz; but this does not alter the validity of the point Sartre introduces through a reference to the music. What is the point? What is Roquentin's \"way out\"? The matter has been debated by many commentators, partly because it is not specified in the book, partly because it raises issues that extend far beyond the book. If Roquentin's way out is to be through art, what use is it to the nonartist? What elements in the music make it suggestive of a possible mode of survival? What does \"survival\" mean in Roquentin's catastrophe? What is the real, ultimate relationship of Roquentin to his former mistress and to the people of Bouville? These are extremely important questions. But they cannot be decided in a few pages, nor can they be answered dogmatically by any individual reader. They are questions that Sartre--at least in this book--purposely leaves open. Later in his philosophical development the idea of freedom became Sartre's main theme. Man, beginning in the loathsome emptiness of his existence, creates his essence--his self, his being -- through the choices that he freely makes. Hence his being is never fixed. He is always becoming, and if it were not for the contingency of death he would never end. Nor would his philosophy. \"Existentialists,\" wrote the Irish philosopher Arland Ussher, \"have a notable difficulty in finishing their books: of necessity, for their philosophy--staying close to the movement of life--can have no finality.\" To what extent this applies to Nausea the individual reader must decide. Another question, even more difficult, is the line between jest and sermon in the novel. Sartre, for all his anguished disgust, can play the clown as well, and has done so often enough; a sort of fool at the metaphysical court. How much self-mockery is detectable in Roquentin's account of the chestnut tree? Some, certainly. The rhetoric at points turns coy: the \"suspicious transparency\" of the glass of beer, the trees that \"did not want to exist\" and \"quietly minded their own business.\" And what does Roquentin mean, at the end of the episode, by the \"smile of the trees\" that \"meant something . . . the real secret of existence\"? What is the relationship between the smile of the trees and Roquentin's description of the jazz recording: \"The disc is scratched and wearing out, perhaps the singer is dead. . . . But behind the existence which falls from one present to the other, without a past, without a future, behind these sounds which decompose from day to day, peel off and slip towards death, the melody stays the same, young and firm, like a pitiless witness\"? What is the \"melody\"? For that matter, what is the novel, which is another kind of melody? Is it a good novel? Is it a work of art? We know that Sartre, the philosopher, is also a marvelous writer; in the techniques of realistic fiction--the construction of dialogue, the evocation of scene and mood--he is the equal of anyone. But a novel is more than technique; it is a self-consistent and dynamic whole. As if this weren't difficult enough, Sartre compounds the aesthetic problems by insisting that the novel must conform to the details of his philosophy. He is not content, like some philosophers, to write fable, allegory, or a philosophical tale in the manner of Candide; he is content only with a proper work of art that is at the same time a synthesis of philosophical specifications. A tall order; and the critics, although widely divergent in their interpretation of the substance of Nausea, seem to agree that Sartre, brilliant though his verbal gifts may be, has not quite brought it off. Germaine Bree and Margaret Guiton (in An Age of Fiction, 1957) have written: \"When Sartre, the philosopher, informs us that we have an immediate intuition of existence in the sensations of boredom and of nausea, we tend to raise an eyebrow. But when Sartre, the novelist, describes this situation, we are almost convinced.\" William Barrett, a keener critic of the philosophy, has called Nausea Sartre's best novel \"for the very reason that in it the intellectual and the creative artist come closest to being joined,\" but the joining is not complete: \"Nausea is not so much a full novel as an extraordinary fragment of one.\" Similarly a recent anonymous critic, writing in the London Times Literary Supplement, has mentioned the \"bite and energy . . . [of] the best pages of La Nausee.\" And so on and so on. The tone of reluctant praise--\"almost,\" \"fragment,\" \"the best pages\"--pervades nearly all the criticism of Sartre's fiction. Literary critics are a cheerless, canny breed, inclined always to say that a given work has its good and bad points. Perhaps the best comment on their scrupulosity is that Nausea was published twenty-six years ago and they are still writing about it. Something must hold their attention. If it is not Sartre's novel-istic technique, then perhaps novelistic technique is not a just criterion of what is pertinent or valuable. Certainly Nausea gives us a few of the clearest and hence most useful images of man in our time that we possess; and this, as Allen Tate has said, is the supreme function of art. William Blake once remarked that he had to create his own system of thought in order to avoid being enslaved by those of others, and Sartre has said that genius is what a man invents when he is looking for a way out. The power of Sartre's fiction resides in the truth of our lives as he has written it. The validity of his fiction resides not only in the genius but in the courage that he has invented as an example for the age. Editors' Note These notebooks were found among the papers of Antoine Roquentin. They are published without alteration. The first sheet is undated, but there is good reason to believe it was written some weeks before the diary itself. Thus it would have been written around the beginning of January, 1932, at the latest. At that time, Antoine Roquentin, after travelling through Central Europe, North Africa and the Far East, settled in Bou-ville for three years to conclude his historical research on the Marquis de Rollebon. The Editors UNDATED PAGES The best thing would be to write down events from day to day. Keep a diary to see clearly--let none of the nuances or small happenings escape even though they might seem to mean nothing. And above all, classify them. I must tell how I see this table, this street, the people, my packet of tobacco, since those are the things which have changed. I must determine the exact extent and nature of this change. For instance, here is a cardboard box holding my bottle of ink. I should try to tell how I saw it before and now how I1 Well, it's a parallelopiped rectangle, it opens--that's stupid, there's nothing I can say about it. This is what I have to avoid, I must not put in strangeness where there is none. I think that is the big danger in keeping a diary: you exaggerate everything. You continually force the truth because you're always looking for something. On the other hand, it is certain that from one minute to the next--and precisely a propos of this box or any other object at 1 Word left out. all 1 can recapture this impression of day-before-yesterday. I must always be ready, otherwise it will slip through my fingers. I must never2 but carefully note and detail all that happens. Naturally, I can write nothing definite about this Saturday and the day-before-yesterday business. I am already too far from it; the only thing I can say is that in neither case was there anything which could ordinarily be called an event. Saturday the children were playing ducks and drakes and, like them, I wanted to throw a stone into the sea. Just at that moment I stopped, dropped the stone and left. Probably I looked somewhat foolish or absent-minded, because the children laughed behind my back. So much for external things. What has happened inside of me has not left any clear traces. I saw something which disgusted me, but I no longer know whether it was the sea or the stone. The stone was flat and dry, especially on one side, damp and muddy on the other. I held it by the edges with my fingers wide apart so as not to get them dirty. Day before yesterday was much more complicated. And there was also this series of coincidences, of quid-pro-quos that I can't explain to myself. But I'm not going to spend my time putting all that down on paper. Anyhow, it was certain that I was afraid or had some other feeling of that sort. If I had only known what I was afraid of, I would have made a great step forward. The strangest thing is that I am not at all inclined to call myself insane, I clearly see that I am not: all these changes concern objects. At least, that is what I'd like to be sure of. 10.301 Perhaps it was a passing moment of madness after all. There is no trace of it any more. My odd feelings of the other week seem to me quite ridiculous today: I can no longer enter into them. I am quite at ease this evening, quite solidly terre-a-terre in the world. Here is my room facing north-east. Below the Rue des Mutiles and the construction-yard of the new station. From my window I see the red and white flame of the \"Railwaymen's Rendezvous\" at the corner of the Boulevard Victor-Noir. The Paris train has just come in. People are coming out of the old station 2 Word crossed out (possibly \"force\" or \"forge\"), another word added above, is illegible. 1 Evidently in the evening. The following paragraph is much later than the preceding ones. We are inclined to believe it was written the following day at the earliest. and spreading into the streets. I hear steps and voices. A lot of people are waiting for the last tramway. They must make a sad little group around the street light just under my window. Well, they have a few minutes more to wait: the tram won't pass before 10.45. I hope no commercial travellers will come tonight: I have such a desire to sleep and am so much behind in my sleep. A good night, one good night and all this nonsense will be swept away. Ten forty-five: nothing more to fear, they would be here already. Unless it's the day for the man from Rouen. He comes every week. They reserve No. 2, on the second floor for him, the room with a bidet. He might still show up: he often drinks a beer at the \"Railwaymen's Rendezvous\" before going to bed. But he doesn't make too much noise. He is very small and clean with a waxed, black moustache and a wig. Here he is now. Well, when I heard him come up the stairs, it gave me quite a thrill, it was so reassuring: what is there to fear in such a regular world? I think I am cured. Here is tramway number seven, Abattoirs-Grands Bassins. It stops with a clank of iron rails. It's leaving again. Now loaded with suitcases and sleeping children, it's heading towards Grands Bassins, towards the factories in the black East. It's the next to the last tramway; the last one will go by in an hour. I'm going to bed. I'm cured. I'll give up writing my daily impressions, like a little girl in her nice new notebook. In one case only it might be interesting to keep a diary: it would be if . . .*\n\nwould like to see the truth clearly before it is too late. Tuesday, 30 January: Nothing new. I worked from nine till one in the library. I got Chapter XII started and all that concerns Rollebon's stay in Russia up to the death of Paul I. This work is finished: nothing more to do with it until the final revision. It is one-thirty. I am eating a sandwich in the Cafe Mably, everything is more or less normal. Anyway, everything is always normal in cafes and especially the Cafe Mably, because of the manager, M. Fasquelle, who has a raffish look which is positively reassuring. It will soon be time for his nap and his eyes are pink already, but he stays quick and decisive. He strolls among the tables and speaks confidently to the customers. \"Is everything all right, Monsieur?\" I smile at seeing him thus; when his place empties his head empties too. From two to four the cafe is deserted, then M. Fasquelle takes a few dazed steps, the waiters turn out the lights and he slips into unconsciousness: when this man is lonely he sleeps. There are still about twenty customers left, bachelors, smalltime engineers, office employees. They eat hurriedly in boarding-houses which they call their \"popotes\" and, since they need a little luxury, they come here after their meals. They drink a cup of coffee and play poker dice; they make a little noise, an inconsistent noise which doesn't bother me. In order to exist, they also must consort with others. I live alone, entirely alone. I never speak to anyone, never; I receive nothing, I give nothing. The Self-Taught Man doesn't count. There is Francoise, the woman who runs the \"Railway-men's Rendezvous.\" But do I speak to her? Sometimes after dinner, when she brings my beer, I ask her: \"Have you time this evening?\" She never says no and I follow her into one of the big rooms on the second floor she rents by the hour or by the day. I do not pay her: our need is mutual. She takes pleasure in it Cshe has to have a man a day and she has many more besides me) and thus I purge myself of a certain nostalgia the cause of which I know too well. But we hardly speak. What good is it? Every man for himself: besides, as far as she's concerned, I am preeminently a customer in her cafe. Taking off her dress, she tells me: \"Say, have you ever heard of that aperitif, Bricot? Because there are two customers who asked for some this week. The girl didn't know and she came to ask me. They were commercial travellers, they must have drunk that in Paris. But I don't like to buy without knowing. I'll keep my stockings on if you don't mind.\" In the past--even a long while after she left me--I thought about Anny. Now I think of no one any more. I don't even bother looking for words. It flows in me, more or less quickly. I fix nothing, I let it go. Through the lack of attaching myself to words, my thoughts remain nebulous most of the time. They sketch vague, pleasant shapes and then are swallowed up: I forget them almost immediately. I marvel at these young people: drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories. If they are asked what they did yesterday, they aren't embarrassed: they bring you up to date in a few words. If I were in their place, I'd fall over myself. It's true that no one has bothered about how I spend my time for a long while. When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell something: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends. You let events flow past; suddenly you see people pop up who speak and who go away, you plunge into stories without beginning or end: you'd make a terrible witness. But in compensation, one misses nothing, no improbability or story too tall to be believed in cafes. For example, Saturday, about four in the afternoon, on the end of the timbered sidewalk of the new station yard, a little woman in sky blue was running backwards, laughing, waving a handkerchief. At the same time, a Negro in a cream-coloured raincoat, yellow shoes and a green hat, turned the corner of the street and whistled. Still going backwards, the woman bumped into him, underneath a lantern which hangs on a paling and which is lit at night. All at once there was the paling smelling strongly of wet wood, this lantern and this little blonde woman in the Negro's arms under a sky the colour of fire. If there had been four or five of us, I suppose we would have noticed the jolt, the soft colours, the beautiful blue coat that looked like an eiderdown quilt, the light raincoat, the red panes of the lantern; we would have laughed at the stupefaction which appeared on those two childish faces. A man rarely feels like laughing alone: the whole thing was animated enough for me, but it was a strong, even a fierce, yet pure sensation. Then everything came asunder, there was nothing left but the lantern, the palisade and the sky; it was still rather beautiful. An hour later the lantern was lit, the wind blew, the sky was black; nothing at all was left. All that is nothing new; I have never resisted these harmless emotions; far from it. You must be just a little bit lonely in order to feel them, just lonely enough to get rid of plausibility at the proper time. But I remained close to people, on the surface of solitude, quite resolved to take refuge in their midst in case of emergency. Up to now I was an amateur at heart. Everywhere, now, there are objects like this glass of beer on the table there. When I see it, I feel like saying: \"Enough.\" I realize quite well that I have gone too far. I don't suppose you can \"take sides\" with solitude. That doesn't mean that I look under my bed before going to sleep, or think I see the door of my room open suddenly in the middle of the night. Still, somehow I am not at peace: I have been avoiding looking at this glass of beer for half an hour. I look above, below, right and left; but I don't want to see it. And I know very well that all these bachelors around me can be of no help: it is too late, I can no longer take refuge among them. They could come and tap me on the shoulder and say, \"Well, what's the matter with that glass of beer?\" It's just like all the others. It's bevelled on the edges, has a handle, a little coat of arms with a spade on it and on the coat of arms is written \"Spartenbrau,\" I know all that, but I know there is something else. Almost nothing. But I can't explain what I see. To anyone. There: I am quietly slipping into the water's depths, towards fear. I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices. All these creatures spend their time explaining, realizing happily that they agree with each other. In Heaven's name, why is it so important to think the same things all together. It's enough to see the face they make when one of these fishyeyed men with an inward look and with whom no agreement is possible, passes them. When I was eight years old and used to play in the Luxembourg gardens there was a man who came and sat in a sentry-box, against the iron fence which runs along the Rue Auguste-Comte. He did not speak but from time to time stretched out his leg and looked at his foot fearfully. The foot was encased in a boot, but the other one was in a slipper. The guard told my uncle that the man was a former proctor. They retired him because he used to come, dressed up as an academician, to read the school term marks. We had a horrible fear of him because we sensed he was alone. One day he smiled at Robert, holding out his arms to him from a distance: Robert almost fainted. It wasn't this creature's poverty-stricken look which frightened us, nor the tumour he had on his neck that rubbed against the edge of his collar: but we felt that he was shaping thoughts of crab or lobster in his head. And that terrified us, the fact that one could conjure thoughts of lobsters on the sentry-box, on our hoops, on the bushes. Is that what awaits me then? For the first time I am disturbed at being alone. I would like to tell someone what is happening to me before it is too late and before I start frightening little boys. I wish Anny were here. This is odd: I have just filled up ten pages and I haven't told the truth--at least, not the whole truth. I was writing \"Nothing new\" with a bad conscience: as a matter of fact I boggled at bringing out a quite harmless little incident. \"Nothing new.\" I admire the way we can lie, putting reason on our side. Evidently, nothing new has happened, if you care to put it that way: this morning at eight-fifteen, just as I was leaving the Hotel Printania to go to the library, I wanted to and could not pick up a paper lying on the ground. This is all and it is not even an event. Yes --but, to tell the whole truth, I was deeply impressed by it: I felt I was no longer free. I tried unsuccessfully to get rid of this idea at the library. I wanted to escape from it at the Cafe Mably. I hoped it would disappear in the bright light. But it stayed there, like a dead weight inside me. It is responsible for the preceding pages. Why didn't I mention it? It must be out of pride, and then, too, a little out of awkwardness. I am not in the habit of telling myself what happens to me, so I cannot quite recapture the succession of events, I cannot distinguish what is important. But now it is finished: I have re-read what I wrote in the Cafe Mably and I am ashamed; I want no secrets or soul-states, nothing ineffable; I am neither virgin nor priest enough to play with the inner life. There is nothing much to say: I could not pick up the paper, that's all. I very much like to pick up chestnuts, old rags and especially papers. It is pleasant to me to pick them up, to close my hand on them; with a little encouragement I would carry them to my mouth the \n\niles when she sees him. Through her, he works his will at court. In March 1820, he marries Mile de Roquelaure, a very beautiful girl of eighteen. M. de Rollebon is seventy; he is at the height of distinction, at the apogee of his life. Seven months later, accused of treason, he is arrested, thrown into a cell, where he dies after five years of imprisonment, without ever being brought to trial.\" I re-read with melancholy this note of Germain Berger.1 It was by those few lines that I first knew M. de Rollebon. How attractive he seemed and how I loved him after these few words! It is for him, for this mannikin that I am here. When I came back from my trip I could just as well have settled down in Paris or Marseilles. But most of the documents concerning the Marquis' long stays in France are in the municipal library of Bouville. Rollebon was the Lord of the Manor of Marmommes. Before the war, you could still find one of his descendants in this little town, an architect named RollebonCampouyre', who, at his death in 1912, left an important legacy to the Bouville library: letters of the Marquis, the fragment of a journal, and all sorts of papers. I have not yet gone through it all. I am glad to have found these notes. I had not read them for ten years. My handwriting has changed, or so it seems to me; I used to write in a smaller hand. How I loved M. de Rollebon that year! I remember one evening--a Tuesday evening: I had worked all day in the Mazarine; I had just gathered, from his correspondence, of 1789-90, in what a magisterial way he duped 1 Editor's Footnote: Germain Berger: Mirabeau-Tonneau et ses amis, page 406, note 2. Champion 1906. Nerciat. It was dark, I was going down the Avenue du Maine and I bought some chestnuts at the corner of the Rue de la Gaite\\ Was I happy! I laughed all by myself thinking of the face Nerciat must have made when he came back from Germany. The face of the Marquis is like this ink: it has paled considerably since I have worked over it. In the first place, starting from 1801, I understand nothing more about his conduct. It is not the lack of documents: letters, fragments of memoirs, secret reports, police records. On the contrary I have almost too many of them. What is lacking in all this testimony is firmness and consistency. They do not contradict each other, neither do they agree with each other; they do not seem to be about the same person. And yet other historians work from the same sources of information. How do they do it? Am I more scrupulous or less intelligent? In any case, the question leaves me completely cold. In truth, what am I looking for? I don't know. For a long time, Rollebon the man has interested me more than the book to be written. But now, the man . . . the man begins to bore me. It is the book which attracts me. I feel more and more need to write--in the same proportion as I grow old, you might say. Evidently it must be admitted that Rollebon took an active part in the assassination of Paul I, that he then accepted an extremely important espionage mission to the Orient from the Czar and constantly betrayed Alexander to the advantage of Napoleon. At the same time he was able to carry on an active correspondence with the Comte d'Artois and send him unimportant information in order to convince him of his fidelity: none of all that is improbable; Fouche, at the same time, was playing a comedy much more dangerous and complex. Perhaps the Marquis also carried on a rifle-supplying business with the Asiatic principalities for his own profit. Well, yes: he could have done all that, but it is not proved: I am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. These are honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so definitely that they come from me, and that they are simply a way of unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon's side. Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigour of the order I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them. I have the feeling of doing a work of pure imagination. And I am certain that the characters in a novel would nave a more genuine appearance, or, in any case, would be more agreeable. Friday: Three o'clock. Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do. An odd moment in the afternoon. Today it is intolerable. A cold sun whitens the dust on the window-panes. Pale sky clouded with white. The gutters were frozen this morning. I ruminate heavily near the gas stove; I know in advance the day is lost. I shall do nothing good, except, perhaps, after nightfall. It is because of the sun; it ephemerally touches the dirty white wisps of fog, which float in the air above the construction-yards, it flows into my room, all gold, all pale, it spreads four dull, false reflections on my table. My pipe is daubed with a golden varnish which first catches the eye by its bright appearance; you look at it and the varnish melts, nothing is left but a great dull streak on a piece of wood. Everything is like that, everything, even my hands. When the sun begins shining like that the best thing to do is go to bed. Only I slept like a log last night, and I am not sleepy. I liked yesterday's sky so much, a narrow sky, black with rain, pushing against the windows like a ridiculous, touching face. This sun is not ridiculous, quite the contrary. On everything I like, on the rust of the construction girders, on the rotten boards of the fence, a miserly, uncertain light falls, like the look you give, after a sleepless night, on decisions made with enthusiasm the day before, on pages you have written in one spurt without crossing out a word. The four cafes on the Boulevard Victor-Noir, shining in the night, side by side, and which are much more than cafes--aquariums, ships, stars or great white eyes-have lost their ambiguous charm. A perfect day to turn back to one's self: these cold clarities which the sun projects like a judgment shorn of pity, over all creatures--enter through my eyes; I am illuminated within by a diminishing light. I am sure that fifteen minutes would be enough to reach supreme self-contempt. No thank you, I want none of that. Neither shall I re-read what I wrote yesterday on Rollebon's stay in St. Petersburg. I stay seated, my arms hanging, or write a few words, without courage: I yawn, I wait for night to come. When it is dark, the objects and I will come out of limbo. Did KolJebon, or did he not, participate in the assassination of Paul I? That is the question for today: I am that far and can't go on without deciding. According to Tcherkoff, he was paid by Count Pahlen. Most of the other conspirators, Tcherkoff says, were content with deposing and imprisoning the Czar. In fact, Alexander seems to have been a partisan of that solution. But Pahlen, it was alleged, wanted to do away with Paul completely, and M. de Rollebon was charged with persuading the individual conspirators to the assassination. \"He visited each one of them and, with an incomparable power, mimed the scene which was to take place. Thus he caused to be born or developed in them a madness for murder.\" But I suspect Tcherkoff. He is not a reasonable witness, he is a half-mad, sadistic magician: he turns everything into the demoniacal. I cannot see M. de Rollebon in this melodramatic role or as mimic of the assassination scene! Never on your life! He is cold, not carried away: he exposes nothing, he insinuates, and his method, pale and colourless, can succeed only with men of his own level, intriguers accessible to reason, politicians. \"Adhemar de Rollebon,\" writes Mme de Charrieres, \"painted nothing with words, made no gestures, never altered the tone of his voice. He kept his eyes half-closed and one could barely make out, between his lashes, the lowest rim of his grey iris. It has only been within the past few years that I dare confess he bored me beyond all possible limits. He spoke a little in the way AbbPS Mably used to write.\" And this is the man who, by his talent for mimicry? . . . But then how was he able to charm women? Then there is this curious story Segur reports and which seems true to me. \"In 1787, at an inn near Moulins, an old man was dying, a friend of Diderot, trained by the philosophers. The priests of the neighbourhood were nonplussed: they had tried everything in vain; the good man would have no last rites, he was a pantheist. M. de Rollebon, who was passing by and who believed in nothing, bet the Cure of Moulins that he would need less than two hours to bring the sick man back to Christian sentiments. The Cure took the bet and lost: Rollebon began at three in the morning, the sick man confessed at five and died at seven. \"Are you so forceful in argument?\" asked the Cur6, \"You outdo even us.\" \"I did not argue,\" answered M. de Rollebon, \"I made him fear Hell.\" How did he take an effective part in the assassination? That evening, one of his officer friends conducted him to his door. If he had gone out again, how could he have crossed St. P\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndid not recognize her. I looked at her large cheeks which never stopped rushing towards the ears. In the hollow of the cheeks, beneath the cheekbones, there were two pink stains which seemed weary on this poor flesh. The cheeks ran, ran towards the ears and Madeleine smiled: \"What will you have, Monsieur Antoine?\" Then the Nausea seized me, I dropped to a seat, I no longer knew where I was; I saw the colours spin slowly around me, I wanted to vomit. And since that time, the Nausea has not left me, it holds me. I paid, Madeleine took away my saucer. My glass crushes a puddle of yellow beer against the marble table top, a bubble floating in it. The bottom of my seat is broken and in order not to slide, I am compelled to press my heels firmly against the ground; it is cold. On the right, they are playing cards on a woollen cloth. I did not see them when I came in: I simply felt there was a warm packet, half on the seat, half on the table in the back, with pairs of waving arms. Afterwards, Madeleine brought them cards, the cloth and chips in a wooden bowl. There are three or five of them, I don't know, I haven't the courage to look at them. I have a broken spring: I can move my eyes but not my head. The head is all pliable and elastic, as though it had been simply set on my neck; if I turn it, it will fall off. All the same, I hear a short breath and from time to time, out of the corner of my eye I see a reddish flash covered with hair. It is a hand. When the patronne goes shopping her cousin replaces her at the bar. His name is Adolphe. I began looking at him as I sat down and I have kept on because I cannot turn my head. He is in shirtsleeves, with purple suspenders; he has rolled the sleeves of his shirt above the elbows. The suspenders can hardly be seen against the blue shirt, they are all obliterated, buried in the blue, but it is false humility; in fact, they will not let themselves be forgotten, they annoy me by their sheep-like stubbornness, as if, starting to become purple, they stopped somewhere along the way without giving up their pretentions. You feel like saying, \"All right, become purple and let's hear no more about it.\" But now, they stay in suspense, stubborn in their defeat. Sometimes the blue which surrounds them slips over and covers them completely: I stay an instant without seeing them. But it is merely a passing wave, soon the blue pales in places and I see the small island of hesitant purple reappear, grow larger, rejoin and reconstitute the suspenders. Cousin Adolphe has no eyes: his swollen, retracted eyelids open only on a little of the whites. He smiles sleepily; from time to time he snorts, yelps and writhes feebly, like a dreaming dog. His blue cotton shirt stands out joyfully against a chocolate-coloured wall. That too brings on the Nausea. The Nausea is not inside me: I feel it out there in the wall, in the suspenders, everywhere around me. It makes itself one with the cafe, I am the one who is within it. On my right, the warm packet begins to rustle, it waves its pair of arms. \"Here, there's your trump--what are trumps?\" Black neck bent over the game: \"Hahaha! What? He's just played trumps.\" \"I don't know, I didn't see . . .\" \"Yes I played trumps just now.\" \"Ah, good, hearts are trumps then.\" He intones: \"Hearts are trumps, hearts are trumps, hea-arts are trumps.\" Spoken: \"What is it, Sir? What is it, Sir? I take it!\" Again, silence--the taste of sugar in the air at the back of my throat. The smells. The suspenders. The cousin has got up, and taken a few steps, put his hands behind his back, smiling, raising his head and leaning back on his heels. He goes to sleep in this position. He is there, oscillating, always smiling: his cheeks tremble. He is going to fall. He bends backwards, bends, bends, the face turned completely up to the ceiling, then just as he is about to fall, he catches himself adroitly on the ledge of the bar and regains his balance. After which, he starts again. I have enough, I call the waitress: \"Madeleine, if you please, play something on the phonograph. The one I like, you know: Some of these days.\" \"Yes, but maybe that'll bother these gentlemen; these gentlemen don't like music when they're playing. But I'll ask them.\" I make a great effort and turn my head. There are four of them. She bends over a congested old man who wears black-rimmed eyeglasses on the end of his nose. He hides his cards against his chest and glances at me from under the glasses. \"Go ahead, Monsieur.\" Smiles. His teeth are rotten. The red hand does not belong to him, it is his neighbour's, a fellow with a black moustache. This fellow with the moustache has enormous nostrils that could pump air for a whole family and that eat up half his face, but in spite of that, he breathes through his mouth, gasping a little. With them there is also a young man with a face like a dog. I cannot make out the fourth player. The cards fall on the woollen cloth, spinning. The hands with ringed fingers come and pick them up, scratching the cloth with their nails. The hands make white splotches on the cloth, they look puffed up and dusty. Other cards fall, the hands go and come. What an odd occupation: it doesn't look like a game or a rite, or a habit. I think they do it to pass the time, nothing more. But time is too large, it can't be filled up. Everything you plunge into it is stretched and disintegrates. That gesture, for instance, the red hand picking up the cards and fumbling: it is all flabby. It would have to be ripped apart and tailored inside. Madeleine turns the crank on the phonograph. I only hope she has not made a mistake; that she hasn't put on Cavalleria Rusticana, as she did the other day. But no, this is it, I recognize the melody from the very first bars. It is an old rag-time with a vocal refrain. I heard American soldiers whistle it in 1917 in the streets of LaRochelle. It must date from before the War. But the recording is much more recent. Still, it is the oldest record in the collection, a Pathe record for sapphire needle. The vocal chorus will be along shortly: I like that part especially and the abrupt manner in which it throws itself forward, like a cliff against the sea. For the moment, the jazz is playing; there is no melody, only notes, a myriad of tiny jolts. They know no rest, an inflexible order gives birth to them and destroys them without even giving them time to recuperate and exist for themselves. They race, they press forward, they strike me a sharp blow in passing and are obliterated. I would like to hold them back, but I know if I succeeded in stopping one it would remain between my fingers only as a raffish languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even will it. I know few impressions stronger or more harsh. I grow warm, I begin to feel happy. There is nothing extraordinary in this, it is a small happiness of Nausea: it spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of our time--the time of purple suspenders and broken chair seats; it is made of wide, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain. No sooner than born, it is already old, it seems as though I have known it for twenty years. There is another happiness: outside there is this band of steel, the narrow duration of the music which traverses our time through and through, rejecting it, tearing at it with its dry little points; there is another time. \"Monsieur Randu plays hearts . . . and you play an ace. The voice dies away and disappears. Nothing bites on the ribbon of steel, neither the opening door, nor the breath of cold air flowing over my knees, nor the arrival of the veterinary surgeon and his little girl: the music transpierces these vague figures and passes through them. Barely seated, the girl has been seized by it: she holds herself stiffly, her eyes wide open; she listens, rubbing the table with her fist. A few seconds more and the Negress will sing. It seems inevitable, so strong is the necessity of this music: nothing can interrupt it, nothing which comes from this time in which the world has fallen; it will stop of itself, as if by order. If I love this beautiful voice it is especially because of that: it is neither for its fulness nor its sadness, rather because it is the event for which so many notes have been preparing, from so far away, dying that it might be born. And yet I am troubled; it would take so little to make the record stop: a broken spring, the whim of Cousin Adolphe. How strange it is, how moving, that this hardness should be so fragile. Nothing can interrupt it yet all can break it. The last chord has died away. In the brief silence which follows I feel strongly that there it is, that something has happened. Some of these days You'll miss me honey What has just happened is that the Nausea has disappeared. When the voice was heard in the silence, I felt my body harden and the Nausea vanish. Suddenly: it was almost unbearable to become so hard, so brilliant. At the same time the music was drawn out, dilated, swelled like a waterspout. It filled the room with its metallic transparency, crushing our miserable time against the walls. I am in the music. Globes of fire turn in the mirrors; encircled by rings of smoke, veiling and unveiling the hard smile of light. My glass of beer has shrunk, it seems heaped up on the table, it looks dense and indispensable. I want to pick it up and feel the weight of it, I stretch out my hand . . . God! That is what has changed, my gestures. This movement of my arm has developed like a majestic theme, it has glided along the song of the Negress; I seemed to be dancing. Adolphe's face is there, set against the chocolate-coloured wall; he seems quite close. Just at the moment when my hand closed, I saw his face; it witnessed to the necessity of a conclusion. I press my fingers against the glass, I look at Adolphe: I am happy. *VoiW.\" A voice rises from the tumult. My neighbour is speaking, the old man burns. His cheeks make a violet stain on the brown leather of the bench. He slaps a card down on the table. Diamonds. But the dog-faced young man smiles. The flushed opponent, bent over the table, watches him like a cat ready to spring. \"Et voila!\" The hand of the young man rises from the shadow, glides an instant, white, indolent, then suddenly drops like a hawk and presses a card against the cloth. The great red-faced man leaps up: \"Hell! He's trumped.\" The outline of the king of hearts appears between his curled fingers, then it is turned on its face and the game goes on. Mighty king, come from so far, prepared by so many combinations, by so many vanished gestures. He disappears in turn so that other combinations can be born, other gestures, attacks, counterattacks, turns of luck, a crowd of small adventures. I am touched, I feel my body at rest like a precision machine. I have had real adventures. I can recapture no detail but I perceive the rigorous succession of circumstances. I have crossed seas, left cities behind me, followed the course of rivers or plunged into forests, always making my way towards other cities. I have had women, I have fought with men; and never was I able to turn back, any more than a record can be reversed. And all that led me--where? At this very instant, on this bench, in this translucent bubble all humming with music. And when you leave me Yes, I who loved so much to sit on the banks of the Tiber at Rome, or in the evening, in Barcelona, ascend and descend the Ramblas a hundred times, I, who near Angkor, on the island of Baray Prah-Kan, saw a banyan tree knot its roots about a Naga chapel, I am here, living in the same second as these card players, I listen to a Negress sing while outside roves the feeble night. The record stops. Night has entered, sweetish, hesitant. No one sees it, but it is there, veiling the lamps; I breathe something opaque in the air: it is night. It is cold. One of the players pushes a disordered pack of cards towards another man who picks them up. One card has stayed behind.

If then that friend demand\nwhy Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:\n--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved\nRome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and\ndie all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live\nall free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;\nas he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was\nvaliant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I\nslew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his\nfortune; honour for his valour; and death for his\nambition. Who is here so base that would be a\nbondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.\nWho is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If\nany, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so\nvile that will not love his country?

Bear with me;\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.\nFirst Citizen\nMethinks there is much reason in his sayings.\nSecond Citizen\nIf thou consider rightly of the matter,\nCaesar has had great wrong.\nThird Citizen\nHas he, masters?\nI fear there will a worse come in his place.\nFourth Citizen\nMark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;\nTherefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.\nFirst Citizen\nIf it be found so, some will dear abide it.\nSecond Citizen\nPoor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.\nThird Citizen\nThere's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\nFourth Citizen\nNow mark him, he begins again to speak.\nANTONY\nBut yesterday the word of Caesar might\nHave stood against the world; now lies he there.\nAnd none so poor to do him reverence.\nO masters, if I were disposed to stir\nYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\nI should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,\nWho, you all know, are honourable men:\nI will not do them wrong; I rather choose\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\nThan I will wrong such honourable men.\nBut here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;\nI found it in his closet, 'tis his will:\nLet but the commons hear this testament--\nWhich, pardon me, I do not mean to read--\nAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds\nAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood,\nYea, beg a hair of him for memory,\nAnd, dying, mention it within their wills,\nBequeathing it as a rich legacy\nUnto their issue.\nFourth Citizen\nWe'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.\nAll\nThe will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.\nANTONY\nHave patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;\nIt is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\nYou are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\nAnd, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,\nIt will inflame you, it will make you mad:\n'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;\nFor, if you should, O, what would come of it!\nFourth Citizen\nRead the will; we'll hear it, Antony;\nYou shall read us the will, Caesar's will.\nANTONY\nWill you be patient? will you stay awhile?\nI have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:\nI fear I wrong the honourable men\nWhose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.\nFourth Citizen\nThey were traitors: honourable men!\nAll\nThe will! the testament!\nSecond Citizen\nThey were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.\nANTONY\nYou will compel me, then, to read the will?\nThen make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,\nAnd let me show you him that made the will.\nShall I descend? and will you give me leave?\nSeveral Citizens\nCome down.\nSecond Citizen\nDescend.\nThird Citizen\nYou shall have leave.\nANTONY comes down\nFourth Citizen\nA ring; stand round.\nFirst Citizen\nStand from the hearse, stand from the body.\nSecond Citizen\nRoom for Antony, most noble Antony.\nANTONY\nNay, press not so upon me; stand far off.\nSeveral Citizens\nStand back; room; bear back.\nANTONY\nIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\nYou all do know this mantle: I remember\nThe first time ever Caesar put it on;\n'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,\nThat day he overcame the Nervii:\nLook, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:\nSee what a rent the envious Casca made:\nThrough this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;\nAnd as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,\nMark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,\nAs rushing out of doors, to be resolved\nIf Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:\nJudge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all;\nFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,\nQuite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;\nAnd, in his mantle muffling up his face,\nEven at the base of Pompey's statua,\nWhich all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\nO, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\nThen I, and you, and all of us fell down,\nWhilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.\nO, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel\nThe dint of pity: these are gracious drops.\nKind souls, what, weep you when you but behold\nOur Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,\nHere is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.\nFirst Citizen\nO piteous spectacle!\nSecond Citizen\nO noble Caesar!\nThird Citizen\nO woful day!\nFourth Citizen\nO traitors, villains!\nFirst Citizen\nO most bloody sight!\nSecond Citizen\nWe will be revenged.\nAll\nRevenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!\nLet not a traitor live!\nANTONY\nStay, countrymen.\nFirst Citizen\nPeace there! hear the noble Antony.\nSecond Citizen\nWe'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.\nANTONY\nGood friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\nTo such a sudden flood of mutiny.\nThey that have done this deed are honourable:\nWhat private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\nThat made them do it: they are wise and honourable,\nAnd will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\nI come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:\nI am no orator, as Brutus is;\nBut, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\nThat love my friend; and that they know full well\nThat gave me public leave to speak of him:\nFor I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\nAction, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\nTo stir men's blood: I only speak right on;\nI tell you that which you yourselves do know;\nShow you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,\nAnd bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,\nAnd Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\nWould ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue\nIn every wound of Caesar that should move\nThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\nAll\nWe'll mutiny.\nFirst Citizen\nWe'll burn the house of Brutus.\nThird Citizen\nAway, then! come, seek the conspirators.\nANTONY\nYet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\nAll\nPeace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!\nANTONY\nWhy, friends, you go to do you know not what:\nWherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?\nAlas, you know not: I must tell you then:\nYou have forgot the will I told you of.\nAll\nMost true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.\nANTONY\nHere is the will, and under Caesar's seal.\nTo every Roman citizen he gives,\nTo every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\nSecond Citizen\nMost noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.\nThird Citizen\nO royal Caesar!\nANTONY\nHear me with patience.\nAll\nPeace, ho!\nANTONY\nMoreover, he hath left you all his walks,\nHis private arbours and new-planted orchards,\nOn this side Tiber; he hath left them you,\nAnd to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,\nTo walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.\nHere was a Caesar! when comes such another?\nFirst Citizen\nNever, never. Come, away, away!\nWe'll burn his body in the holy place,\nAnd with the brands fire the traitors' houses.\nTake up the body.\nSecond Citizen\nGo fetch fire.\nThird Citizen\nPluck down benches.\nFourth Citizen\nPluck down forms, windows, any thing.\nExeunt Citizens with the body\nANTONY\nNow let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,\nTake thou what course thou wilt!\nEnter a Servant\nHow now, fellow!\nServant\nSir, Octavius is already come to Rome.\nANTONY\nWhere is he?\nServant\nHe and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.\nANTONY\nAnd thither will I straight to visit him:\nHe comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,\nAnd in this mood will give us any thing.\nServant\nI heard him say, Brutus and Cassius\nAre rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.\nANTONY\nBelike they had some notice of the people,\nHow I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.\nExeunt\nFLAVIUS\nHence! home, you idle creatures get you home:\nIs this a holiday? what! know you not,\nBeing mechanical, you ought not walk\nUpon a labouring day without the sign\nOf your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?\nFirst Commoner\nWhy, sir, a carpenter.\nMARULLUS\nWhere is thy leather apron and thy rule?\nWhat dost thou with thy best apparel on?\nYou, sir, what trade are you?\nSecond Commoner\nTruly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,\nas you would say, a cobbler.\nMARULLUS\nBut what trade art thou? answer me directly.\nSecond Commoner\nA trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe\nconscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.\nMARULLUS\nWhat trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?\nSecond Commoner\nNay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,\nif you be out, sir, I can mend you.\nMARULLUS\nWhat meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!\nSecond Commoner\nWhy, sir, cobble you.\nFLAVIUS\nThou art a cobbler, art thou?\nSecond Commoner\nTruly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I\nmeddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's\nmatters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon\nto old shoes; when they are in great danger, I\nrecover them. As proper men as ever trod upon\nneat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.\nFLAVIUS\nBut wherefore art not in thy shop today?\nWhy dost thou lead these men about the streets?\nSecond Commoner\nTruly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself\ninto more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,\nto see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.\nMARULLUS\nWherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?\nWhat tributaries follow him to Rome,\nTo grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?\nYou blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!\nO you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,\nKnew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft\nHave you climb'd up to walls and battlements,\nTo towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,\nYour infants in your arms, and there have sat\nThe livelong day, with patient expectation,\nTo see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:\nAnd when you saw his chariot but appear,\nHave you not made an universal shout,\nThat Tiber trembled underneath her banks,\nTo hear the replication of your sounds\nMade in her concave shores?\nAnd do you now put on your best attire?\nAnd do you now cull out a holiday?\nAnd do you now strew flowers in his way\nThat comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!\nRun to your houses, fall upon your knees,\nPray to the gods to intermit the plague\nThat needs must light on this ingratitude.\nFLAVIUS\nGo, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,\nAssemble all the poor men of your sort;\nDraw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears\nInto the channel, till the lowest stream\nDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.\nExeunt all the Commoners\nSee whether their basest metal be not moved;\nThey vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.\nGo you down that way towards the Capitol;\nThis way will I\ndisrobe the images,\nIf you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.\nMARULLUS\nMay we do so?\nYou know it is the feast of Lupercal.\nFLAVIUS\nIt is no matter; let no images\nBe hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,\nAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets:\nSo do you too, where you perceive them thick.\nThese growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\nWho else would soar above the view of men\nAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.\nExeunt\nSCENE II. A public place.\n\nFlourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course; CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer\nCAESAR\nCalpurnia!\nCASCA\nPeace, ho! Caesar speaks.\nCAESAR\nCalpurnia!\nCALPURNIA\nHere, my lord.\nCAESAR\nStand you directly in Antonius' way,\nWhen he doth run his course. Antonius!\nANTONY\nCaesar, my lord?\nCAESAR\nForget not, in your speed, Antonius,\nTo touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,\nThe barren, touched in this holy chase,\nShake off their sterile curse.\nANTONY\nI shall remember:\nWhen Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.\nCAESAR\nSet on; and leave no ceremony out.\nFlourish\nSoothsayer\nCaesar!\nCAESAR\nHa! who calls?\nCASCA\nBid every noise be still: peace yet again!\nCAESAR\nWho is it in the press that calls on me?\nI hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,\nCry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.\nSoothsayer\nBeware the ides of March.\nCAESAR\nWhat man is that?\nBRUTUS\nA soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.\nCAESAR\nSet him before me; let me see his face.\nCASSIUS\nFellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.\nCAESAR\nWhat say'st thou to me now? speak once again.\nSoothsayer\nBeware the ides of March.\nCAESAR\nHe is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.\nSennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS\nCASSIUS\nWill you go see the order of the course?\nBRUTUS\nNot I.\nCASSIUS\nI pray you, do.\nBRUTUS\nI am not gamesome: I do lack some part\nOf that quick spirit that is in Antony.\nLet me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;\nI'll leave you.\nCASSIUS\nBrutus, I do observe you now of late:\nI have not from your eyes that gentleness\nAnd show of love as I was wont to have:\nYou bear too stubborn and too strange a hand\nOver your friend that loves you.\nBRUTUS\nCassius,\nBe not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,\nI turn the trouble of my countenance\nMerely upon myself. Vexed I am\nOf late with passions of some difference,\nConceptions only proper to myself,\nWhich give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;\nBut let not therefore my good friends be grieved--\nAmong which number, Cassius, be you one--\nNor construe any further my neglect,\nThan that poor Brutus, with himself at war,\nForgets the shows of love to other men.\nCASSIUS\nThen, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;\nBy means whereof this breast of mine hath buried\nThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\nTell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\nBRUTUS\nNo, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,\nBut by reflection, by some other things.\nCASSIUS\n'Tis just:\nAnd it is very much lamented, Brutus,\nThat you have no such mirrors as will turn\nYour hidden worthiness into your eye,\nThat you might see your shadow. I have heard,\nWhere many of the best respect in Rome,\nExcept immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus\nAnd groaning underneath this age's yoke,\nHave wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.\nBRUTUS\nInto what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\nThat you would have me seek into myself\nFor that which is not in me?\nCASSIUS\nTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:\nAnd since you know you cannot see yourself\nSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,\nWill modestly discover to yourself\nThat of yourself which you yet know not of.\nAnd be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:\nWere I a common laugher, or did use\nTo stale with ordinary oaths my love\nTo every new protester; if you know\nThat I do fawn on men and hug them hard\nAnd after scandal them, or if you know\nThat I profess myself in banqueting\nTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\nFlourish, and shout\nBRUTUS\nWhat means this shouting? I do fear, the people\nChoose Caesar for their king.\nCASSIUS\nAy, do you fear it?\nThen must I think you would not have it so.\nBRUTUS\nI would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.\nBut wherefore do you hold me here so long?\nWhat is it that you would impart to me?\nIf it be aught toward the general good,\nSet honour in one eye and death i' the other,\nAnd I will look on both indifferently,\nFor let the gods so speed me as I love\nThe name of honour more than I fear death.\nCASSIUS\nI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\nAs well as I do know your outward favour.\nWell, honour is the subject of my story.\nI cannot tell what you and other men\nThink of this life; but, for my single self,\nI had as lief not be as live to be\nIn awe of such a thing as I myself.\nI was born free as Caesar; so were you:\nWe both have fed as well, and we can both\nEndure the winter's cold as well as he:\nFor once, upon a raw and gusty day,\nThe troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\nCaesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now\nLeap in with me into this angry flood,\nAnd swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,\nAccoutred as I was, I plunged in\nAnd bade him follow; so indeed he did.\nThe torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it\nWith lusty sinews, throwing it aside\nAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy;\nBut ere we could arrive the point proposed,\nCaesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'\nI, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,\nDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder\nThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\nDid I the tired Caesar. And this man\nIs now become a god, and Cassius is\nA wretched creature and must bend his body,\nIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\nHe had a fever when he was in Spain,\nAnd when the fit was on him, I did mark\nHow he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;\nHis coward lips did from their colour fly,\nAnd that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\nDid lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:\nAy, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans\nMark him and write his speeches in their books,\nAlas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'\nAs a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me\nA man of such a feeble temper should\nSo get the start of the majestic world\nAnd bear the palm alone.\nShout. Flourish\nBRUTUS\nAnother general shout!\nI do believe that these applauses are\nFor some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.\nCASSIUS\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\nWalk under his huge legs and peep about\nTo find ourselves dishonourable graves.\nMen at some time are masters of their fates:\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\nBrutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?\nWhy should that name be sounded more than yours?\nWrite them together, yours is as fair a name;\nSound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\nWeigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,\nBrutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.\nNow, in the names of all the gods at once,\nUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,\nThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\nWhen went there by an age, since the great flood,\nBut it was famed with more than with one man?\nWhen could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,\nThat her wide walls encompass'd but one man?\nNow is it Rome indeed and room enough,\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say,\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brook'd\nThe eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\nAs easily as a king.\nBRUTUS\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous;\nWhat you would work me to, I have some aim:\nHow I have thought of this and of these times,\nI shall recount hereafter; for this present,\nI would not, so with love I might entreat you,\nBe any further moved. What you have said\nI will consider; what you have to say\nI will with patience hear, and find a time\nBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.\nTill then, my noble friend, chew upon this:\nBrutus had rather be a villager\nThan to repute himself a son of Rome\nUnder these hard conditions as this time\nIs like to lay upon us.\nCASSIUS\nI am glad that my weak words\nHave struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.\nBRUTUS\nThe games are done and Caesar is returning.\nCASSIUS\nAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;\nAnd he will, after his sour fashion, tell you\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note to-day.\nRe-enter CAESAR and his Train\nBRUTUS\nI will do so. But, look you, Cassius,\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,\nAnd all the rest look like a chidden train:\nCalpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero\nLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\nAs we have seen him in the Capitol,\nBeing cross'd in conference by some senators.\nCASSIUS\nCasca will tell us what the matter is.\nCAESAR\nAntonius!\nANTONY\nCaesar?\nCAESAR\nLet me have men about me that are fat;\nSleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;\nHe thinks too much: such men are dangerous.\nANTONY\nFear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;\nHe is a noble Roman and well given.\nCAESAR\nWould he were fatter! But I fear him not:\nYet if my name were liable to fear,\nI do not know the man I should avoid\nSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;\nHe is a great observer and he looks\nQuite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,\nAs thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;\nSeldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort\nAs if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit\nThat could be moved to smile at any thing.\nSuch men as he be never at heart's ease\nWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous.\nI rather tell thee what is to be fear'd\nThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.\nCome on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\nAnd tell me truly what thou think'st of him.\nSennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA\nCASCA\nYou pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?\nBRUTUS\nAy, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,\nThat Caesar looks so sad.\nCASCA\nWhy, you were with him, were you not?\nBRUTUS\nI should not then ask Casca what had chanced.\nCASCA\nWhy, there was a crown offered him: and being\noffered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,\nthus; and then the people fell a-shouting.\nBRUTUS\nWhat was the second noise for?\nCASCA\nWhy, for that too.\nCASSIUS\nThey shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?\nCASCA\nWhy, for that too.\nBRUTUS\nWas the crown offered him thrice?\nCASCA\nAy, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every\ntime gentler than other, and at every putting-by\nmine honest neighbours shouted.\nCASSIUS\nWho offered him the crown?\nCASCA\nWhy, Antony.\nBRUTUS\nTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\nCASCA\nI can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:\nit was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark\nAntony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown\nneither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told\nyou, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my\nthinking, he would fain have had it. Then he\noffered it to him again; then he put it by again:\nbut, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his\nfingers off it. And then he offered it the third\ntime; he put it the third time by: and still as he\nrefused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their\nchapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps\nand uttered such a deal of stinking breath because\nCaesar refused the crown that it had almost choked\nCaesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and\nfor mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of\nopening my lips and receiving the bad air.\nCASSIUS\nBut, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?\nCASCA\nHe fell down in the market-place, and foamed at\nmouth, and was speechless.\nBRUTUS\n'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.\nCASSIUS\nNo, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,\nAnd honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.\nCASCA\nI know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,\nCaesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not\nclap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and\ndispleased them, as they use to do the players in\nthe theatre, I am no true man.\nBRUTUS\nWhat said he when he came unto himself?\nCASCA\nMarry, before he fell down, when he perceived the\ncommon herd was glad he refused the crown, he\nplucked me ope his doublet and offered them his\nthroat to cut. An I had been a man of any\noccupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,\nI would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so\nhe fell. When he came to himself again, he said,\nIf he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired\ntheir worships to think it was his infirmity. Three\nor four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good\nsoul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but\nthere's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had\nstabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.\nBRUTUS\nAnd after that, he came, thus sad, away?\nCASCA\nAy.\nCASSIUS\nDid Cicero say any thing?\nCASCA\nAy, he spoke Greek.\nCASSIUS\nTo what effect?\nCASCA\nNay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the\nface again: but those that understood him smiled at\none another and shook their heads; but, for mine own\npart, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more\nnews too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs\noff Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you\nwell. There was more foolery yet, if I could\nremember it.\nCASSIUS\nWill you sup with me to-night, Casca?\nCASCA\nNo, I am promised forth.\nCASSIUS\nWill you dine with me to-morrow?\nCASCA\nAy, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner\nworth the eating.\nCASSIUS\nGood: I will expect you.\nCASCA\nDo so. Farewell, both.\nExit\nBRUTUS\nWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\nHe was quick mettle when he went to school.\nCASSIUS\nSo is he now in execution\nOf any bold or noble enterprise,\nHowever he puts on this tardy form.\nThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\nWhich gives men stomach to digest his words\nWith better appetite.\nBRUTUS\nAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you:\nTo-morrow, if you please to speak with me,\nI will come home to you; or, if you will,\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you.\nCASSIUS\nI will do so: till then, think of the world.\nExit BRUTUS\nWell, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,\nThy honourable metal may be wrought\nFrom that it is disposed: therefore it is meet\nThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;\nFor who so firm that cannot be seduced?\nCaesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:\nIf I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,\nHe should not humour me. I will this night,\nIn several hands, in at his windows throw,\nAs if they came from several citizens,\nWritings all tending to the great opinion\nThat Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely\nCaesar's ambition shall be glanced at:\nAnd after this let Caesar seat him sure;\nFor we will shake him, or worse days endure.\nExit\nSCENE III. The same. A street.\n\nThunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO\nCICERO\nGood even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?\nWhy are you breathless? and why stare you so?\nCASCA\nAre not you moved, when all the sway of earth\nShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\nI have seen tempests, when the scolding winds\nHave rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen\nThe ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,\nTo be exalted with the threatening clouds:\nBut never till to-night, never till now,\nDid I go through a tempest dropping fire.\nEither there is a civil strife in heaven,\nOr else the world, too saucy with the gods,\nIncenses them to send destruction.\nCICERO\nWhy, saw you any thing more wonderful?\nCASCA\nA common slave--you know him well by sight--\nHeld up his left hand, which did flame and burn\nLike twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,\nNot sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.\nBesides--I ha' not since put up my sword--\nAgainst the Capitol I met a lion,\nWho glared upon me, and went surly by,\nWithout annoying me: and there were drawn\nUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women,\nTransformed with their fear; who swore they saw\nMen all in fire walk up and down the streets.\nAnd yesterday the bird of night did sit\nEven at noon-day upon the market-place,\nHooting and shrieking. When these prodigies\nDo so conjointly meet, let not men say\n'These are their reasons; they are natural;'\nFor, I believe, they are portentous things\nUnto the climate that they point upon.\nCICERO\nIndeed, it is a strange-disposed time:\nBut men may construe things after their fashion,\nClean from the purpose of the things themselves.\nCome Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?\nCASCA\nHe doth; for he did bid Antonius\nSend word to you he would be there to-morrow.\nCICERO\nGood night then, Casca: this disturbed sky\nIs not to walk in.\nCASCA\nFarewell, Cicero.\nExit CICERO\nEnter CASSIUS\nCASSIUS\nWho's there?\nCASCA\nA Roman.\nCASSIUS\nCasca, by your voice.\nCASCA\nYour ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!\nCASSIUS\nA very pleasing night to honest men.\nCASCA\nWho ever knew the heavens menace so?\nCASSIUS\nThose that have known the earth so full of faults.\nFor my part, I have walk'd about the streets,\nSubmitting me unto the perilous night,\nAnd, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,\nHave bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;\nAnd when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open\nThe breast of heaven, I did present myself\nEven in the aim and very flash of it.\nCASCA\nBut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?\nIt is the part of men to fear and tremble,\nWhen the most mighty gods by tokens send\nSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.\nCASSIUS\nYou are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life\nThat should be in a Roman you do want,\nOr else you use not. You look pale and gaze\nAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,\nTo see the strange impatience of the heavens:\nBut if you would consider the true cause\nWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\nWhy birds and beasts from quality and kind,\nWhy old men fool and children calculate,\nWhy all these things change from their ordinance\nTheir natures and preformed faculties\nTo monstrous quality,--why, you shall find\nThat heaven hath infused them with these spirits,\nTo make them instruments of fear and warning\nUnto some monstrous state.\nNow could I, Casca, name to thee a man\nMost like this dreadful night,\nThat thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars\nAs doth the lion in the Capitol,\nA man no mightier than thyself or me\nIn personal action, yet prodigious grown\nAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\nCASCA\n'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?\nCASSIUS\nLet it be who it is: for Romans now\nHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors;\nBut, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,\nAnd we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;\nOur yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\nCASCA\nIndeed, they say the senators tomorrow\nMean to establish Caesar as a king;\nAnd he shall wear his crown by sea and land,\nIn every place, save here in Italy.\nCASSIUS\nI know where I will wear this dagger then;\nCassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:\nTherein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;\nTherein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:\nNor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\nNor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,\nCan be retentive to the strength of spirit;\nBut life, being weary of these worldly bars,\nNever lacks power to dismiss itself.\nIf I know this, know all the world besides,\nThat part of tyranny that I do bear\nI can shake off at pleasure.\nThunder still\nCASCA\nSo can I:\nSo every bondman in his own hand bears\nThe power to cancel his captivity.\nCASSIUS\nAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant then?\nPoor man! I know he would not be a wolf,\nBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep:\nHe were no lion, were not Romans hinds.\nThose that with haste will make a mighty fire\nBegin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,\nWhat rubbish and what offal, when it serves\nFor the base matter to illuminate\nSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,\nWhere hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this\nBefore a willing bondman; then I know\nMy answer must be made. But I am arm'd,\nAnd dangers are to me indifferent.\nCASCA\nYou speak to Casca, and to such a man\nThat is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:\nBe factious for redress of all these griefs,\nAnd I will set this foot of mine as far\nAs who goes farthest.\nCASSIUS\nThere's a bargain made.\nNow know you, Casca, I have moved already\nSome certain of the noblest-minded Romans\nTo undergo with me an enterprise\nOf honourable-dangerous consequence;\nAnd I do know, by this, they stay for me\nIn Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,\nThere is no stir or walking in the streets;\nAnd the complexion of the element\nIn favour's like the work we have in hand,\nMost bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\nCASCA\nStand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\nCASSIUS\n'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;\nHe is a friend.\nEnter CINNA\nCinna, where haste you so?\nCINNA\nTo find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?\nCASSIUS\nNo, it is Casca; one incorporate\nTo our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?\nCINNA\nI am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!\nThere's two or three of us have seen strange sights.\nCASSIUS\nAm I not stay'd for? tell me.\nCINNA\nYes, you are.\nO Cassius, if you could\nBut win the noble Brutus to our party--\nCASSIUS\nBe you content: good Cinna, take this paper,\nAnd look you lay it in the praetor's chair,\nWhere Brutus may but find it; and throw this\nIn at his window; set this up with wax\nUpon old Brutus' statue: all this done,\nRepair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.\nIs Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\nCINNA\nAll but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone\nTo seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,\nAnd so bestow these papers as you bade me.\nCASSIUS\nThat done, repair to Pompey's theatre.\nExit CINNA\nCome, Casca, you and I will yet ere day\nSee Brutus at his house: three parts of him\nIs ours already, and the man entire\nUpon the next encounter yields him ours.\nCASCA\nO, he sits high in all the people's hearts:\nAnd that which would appear offence in us,\nHis countenance, like richest alchemy,\nWill change to virtue and to worthiness.\nCASSIUS\nHim and his worth and our great need of him\nYou have right well conceited. Let us go,\nFor it is after midnight; and ere day\nWe will awake him and be sure of him.\nExeunt\n\nACT II\nSCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.\n\nEnter BRUTUS\nBRUTUS\nWhat, Lucius, ho!\nI cannot, by the progress of the stars,\nGive guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!\nI would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.\nWhen, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!\nEnter LUCIUS\nLUCIUS\nCall'd you, my lord?\nBRUTUS\nGet me a taper in my study, Lucius:\nWhen it is lighted, come and call me here.\nLUCIUS\nI will, my lord.\nExit\nBRUTUS\nIt must be by his death: and for my part,\nI know no personal cause to spurn at him,\nBut for the general. He would be crown'd:\nHow that might change his nature, there's the question.\nIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder;\nAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--\nAnd then, I grant, we put a sting in him,\nThat at his will he may do danger with.\nThe abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins\nRemorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,\nI have not known when his affections sway'd\nMore than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,\nThat lowliness is young ambition's ladder,\nWhereto the climber-upward turns his face;\nBut when he once attains the upmost round.\nHe then unto the ladder turns his back,\nLooks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\nBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may.\nThen, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel\nWill bear no colour for the thing he is,\nFashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,\nWould run to these and these extremities:\nAnd therefore think him as a serpent's egg\nWhich, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,\nAnd kill him in the shell.\nRe-enter LUCIUS\nLUCIUS\nThe taper burneth in your closet, sir.\nSearching the window for a flint, I found\nThis paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,\nIt did not lie there when I went to bed.\nGives him the letter\nBRUTUS\nGet you to bed again; it is not day.\nIs not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?\nLUCIUS\nI know not, sir.\nBRUTUS\nLook in the calendar, and bring me word.\nLUCIUS\nI will, sir.\nExit\nBRUTUS\nThe exhalations whizzing in the air\nGive so much light that I may read by them.\nOpens the letter and reads\n'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.\nShall Rome, & c. Speak, strike, redress!\nBrutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'\nSuch instigations have been often dropp'd\nWhere I have took them up.\n'Shall Rome, & c.' Thus must I piece it out:\nShall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?\nMy ancestors did from the streets of Rome\nThe Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.\n'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated\nTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:\nIf the redress will follow, thou receivest\nThy full petition at the hand of Brutus!\nRe-enter LUCIUS\nLUCIUS\nSir, March is wasted fourteen days.\nKnocking within\nBRUTUS\n'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.\nExit LUCIUS\nSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,\nI have not slept.\nBetween the acting of a dreadful thing\nAnd the first motion, all the interim is\nLike a phantasma, or a hideous dream:\nThe Genius and the mortal instruments\nAre then in council; and the state of man,\nLike to a little kingdom, suffers then\nThe nature of an insurrection.\nRe-enter LUCIUS\nLUCIUS\nSir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,\nWho doth desire to see you.\nBRUTUS\nIs he alone?\nLUCIUS\nNo, sir, there are moe with him.\nBRUTUS\nDo you know them?\nLUCIUS\nNo, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,\nAnd half their faces buried in their cloaks,\nThat by no means I may discover them\nBy any mark of favour.\nBRUTUS\nLet 'em enter.\nExit LUCIUS\nThey are the faction. O conspiracy,\nShamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,\nWhen evils are most free? O, then by day\nWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\nTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;\nHide it in smiles and affability:\nFor if thou path, thy native semblance on,\nNot Erebus itself were dim enough\nTo hide thee from prevention.\nEnter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS\nCASSIUS\nI think we are too bold upon your rest:\nGood morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?\nBRUTUS\nI have been up this hour, awake all night.\nKnow I these men that come along with you?\nCASSIUS\nYes, every man of them, and no man here\nBut honours you; and every one doth wish\nYou had but that opinion of yourself\nWhich every noble Roman bears of you.\nThis is Trebonius.\nBRUTUS\nHe is welcome hither.\nCASSIUS\nThis, Decius Brutus.\nBRUTUS\nHe is welcome too.\nCASSIUS\nThis, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\nBRUTUS\nThey are all welcome.\nWhat watchful cares do interpose themselves\nBetwixt your eyes and night?\nCASSIUS\nShall I entreat a word?\nBRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nHere lies the east: doth not the day break here?\nCASCA\nNo.\nCINNA\nO, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines\nThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.\nCASCA\nYou shall confess that you are both deceived.\nHere, as I point my sword, the sun arises,\nWhich is a great way growing on the south,\nWeighing the youthful season of the year.\nSome two months hence up higher toward the north\nHe first presents his fire; and the high east\nStands, as the Capitol, directly here.\nBRUTUS\nGive me your hands all over, one by one.\nCASSIUS\nAnd let us swear our resolution.\nBRUTUS\nNo, not an oath: if not the face of men,\nThe sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--\nIf these be motives weak, break off betimes,\nAnd every man hence to his idle bed;\nSo let high-sighted tyranny range on,\nTill each man drop by lottery. But if these,\nAs I am sure they do, bear fire enough\nTo kindle cowards and to steel with valour\nThe melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,\nWhat need we any spur but our own cause,\nTo prick us to redress? what other bond\nThan secret Romans, that have spoke the word,\nAnd will not palter? and what other oath\nThan honesty to honesty engaged,\nThat this shall be, or we will fall for it?\nSwear priests and cowards and men cautelous,\nOld feeble carrions and such suffering souls\nThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\nSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\nThe even virtue of our enterprise,\nNor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,\nTo think that or our cause or our performance\nDid need an oath; when every drop of blood\nThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\nIs guilty of a several bastardy,\nIf he do break the smallest particle\nOf any promise that hath pass'd from him.\nCASSIUS\nBut what of Cicero? shall we sound him?\nI think he will stand very strong with us.\nCASCA\nLet us not leave him out.\nCINNA\nNo, by no means.\nMETELLUS CIMBER\nO, let us have him, for his silver hairs\nWill purchase us a good opinion\nAnd buy men's voices to commend our deeds:\nIt shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;\nOur youths and wildness shall no whit appear,\nBut all be buried in his gravity.\nBRUTUS\nO, name him not: let us not break with him;\nFor he will never follow any thing\nThat other men begin.\nCASSIUS\nThen leave him out.\nCASCA\nIndeed he is not fit.\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nShall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?\nCASSIUS\nDecius, well urged: I think it is not meet,\nMark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,\nShould outlive Caesar: we shall find of him\nA shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,\nIf he improve them, may well stretch so far\nAs to annoy us all: which to prevent,\nLet Antony and Caesar fall together.\nBRUTUS\nOur course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,\nTo cut the head off and then hack the limbs,\nLike wrath in death and envy afterwards;\nFor Antony is but a limb of Caesar:\nLet us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\nWe all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;\nAnd in the spirit of men there is no blood:\nO, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,\nAnd not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\nCaesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,\nLet's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;\nLet's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\nNot hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:\nAnd let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\nStir up their servants to an act of rage,\nAnd after seem to chide 'em. This shall make\nOur purpose necessary and not envious:\nWhich so appearing to the common eyes,\nWe shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.\nAnd for Mark Antony, think not of him;\nFor he can do no more than Caesar's arm\nWhen Caesar's head is off.\nCASSIUS\nYet I fear him;\nFor in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--\nBRUTUS\nAlas, good Cassius, do not think of him:\nIf he love Caesar, all that he can do\nIs to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:\nAnd that were much he should; for he is given\nTo sports, to wildness and much company.\nTREBONIUS\nThere is no fear in him; let him not die;\nFor he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.\nClock strikes\nBRUTUS\nPeace! count the clock.\nCASSIUS\nThe clock hath stricken three.\nTREBONIUS\n'Tis time to part.\nCASSIUS\nBut it is doubtful yet,\nWhether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;\nFor he is superstitious grown of late,\nQuite from the main opinion he held once\nOf fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:\nIt may be, these apparent prodigies,\nThe unaccustom'd terror of this night,\nAnd the persuasion of his augurers,\nMay hold him from the Capitol to-day.\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nNever fear that: if he be so resolved,\nI can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear\nThat unicorns may be betray'd with trees,\nAnd bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\nLions with toils and men with flatterers;\nBut when I tell him he hates flatterers,\nHe says he does, being then most flattered.\nLet me work;\nFor I can give his humour the true bent,\nAnd I will bring him to the Capitol.\nCASSIUS\nNay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\nBRUTUS\nBy the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?\nCINNA\nBe that the uttermost, and fail not then.\nMETELLUS CIMBER\nCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\nWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey:\nI wonder none of you have thought of him.\nBRUTUS\nNow, good Metellus, go along by him:\nHe loves me well, and I have given him reasons;\nSend him but hither, and I'll fashion him.\nCASSIUS\nThe morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.\nAnd, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember\nWhat you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.\nBRUTUS\nGood gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;\nLet not our looks put on our purposes,\nBut bear it as our Roman actors do,\nWith untired spirits and formal constancy:\nAnd so good morrow to you every one.\nExeunt all but BRUTUS\nBoy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;\nEnjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:\nThou hast no figures nor no fantasies,\nWhich busy care draws in the brains of men;\nTherefore thou sleep'st so sound.\nEnter PORTIA\nPORTIA\nBrutus, my lord!\nBRUTUS\nPortia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?\nIt is not for your health thus to commit\nYour weak condition to the raw cold morning.\nPORTIA\nNor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,\nStole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,\nYou suddenly arose, and walk'd about,\nMusing and sighing, with your arms across,\nAnd when I ask'd you what the matter was,\nYou stared upon me with ungentle looks;\nI urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,\nAnd too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;\nYet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,\nBut, with an angry wafture of your hand,\nGave sign for me to leave you: so I did;\nFearing to strengthen that impatience\nWhich seem'd too much enkindled, and withal\nHoping it was but an effect of humour,\nWhich sometime hath his hour with every man.\nIt will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,\nAnd could it work so much upon your shape\nAs it hath much prevail'd on your condition,\nI should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,\nMake me acquainted with your cause of grief.\nBRUTUS\nI am not well in health, and that is all.\nPORTIA\nBrutus is wise, and, were he not in health,\nHe would embrace the means to come by it.\nBRUTUS\nWhy, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.\nPORTIA\nIs Brutus sick? and is it physical\nTo walk unbraced and suck up the humours\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed,\nTo dare the vile contagion of the night\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurged air\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;\nYou have some sick offence within your mind,\nWhich, by the right and virtue of my place,\nI ought to know of: and, upon my knees,\nI charm you, by my once-commended beauty,\nBy all your vows of love and that great vow\nWhich did incorporate and make us one,\nThat you unfold to me, yourself, your half,\nWhy you are heavy, and what men to-night\nHave had to resort to you: for here have been\nSome six or seven, who did hide their faces\nEven from darkness.\nBRUTUS\nKneel not, gentle Portia.\nPORTIA\nI should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\nWithin the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\nIs it excepted I should know no secrets\nThat appertain to you? Am I yourself\nBut, as it were, in sort or limitation,\nTo keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\nAnd talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs\nOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,\nPortia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.\nBRUTUS\nYou are my true and honourable wife,\nAs dear to me as are the ruddy drops\nThat visit my sad heart\nPORTIA\nIf this were true, then should I know this secret.\nI grant I am a woman; but withal\nA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:\nI grant I am a woman; but withal\nA woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.\nThink you I am no stronger than my sex,\nBeing so father'd and so husbanded?\nTell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:\nI have made strong proof of my constancy,\nGiving myself a voluntary wound\nHere, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.\nAnd not my husband's secrets?\nBRUTUS\nO ye gods,\nRender me worthy of this noble wife!\nKnocking within\nHark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;\nAnd by and by thy bosom shall partake\nThe secrets of my heart.\nAll my engagements I will construe to thee,\nAll the charactery of my sad brows:\nLeave me with haste.\nExit PORTIA\nLucius, who's that knocks?\nRe-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS\nLUCIUS\nHe is a sick man that would speak with you.\nBRUTUS\nCaius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.\nBoy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?\nLIGARIUS\nVouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.\nBRUTUS\nO, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,\nTo wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\nLIGARIUS\nI am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\nAny exploit worthy the name of honour.\nBRUTUS\nSuch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\nHad you a healthful ear to hear of it.\nLIGARIUS\nBy all the gods that Romans bow before,\nI here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!\nBrave son, derived from honourable loins!\nThou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up\nMy mortified spirit. Now bid me run,\nAnd I will strive with things impossible;\nYea, get the better of them. What's to do?\nBRUTUS\nA piece of work that will make sick men whole.\nLIGARIUS\nBut are not some whole that we must make sick?\nBRUTUS\nThat must we also. What it is, my Caius,\nI shall unfold to thee, as we are going\nTo whom it must be done.\nLIGARIUS\nSet on your foot,\nAnd with a heart new-fired I follow you,\nTo do I know not what: but it sufficeth\nThat Brutus leads me on.\nBRUTUS\nFollow me, then.\nExeunt\nSCENE II. CAESAR's house.\n\nThunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown\nCAESAR\nNor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:\nThrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,\n'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?\nEnter a Servant\nServant\nMy lord?\nCAESAR\nGo bid the priests do present sacrifice\nAnd bring me their opinions of success.\nServant\nI will, my lord.\nExit\nEnter CALPURNIA\nCALPURNIA\nWhat mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?\nYou shall not stir out of your house to-day.\nCAESAR\nCaesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me\nNe'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see\nThe face of Caesar, they are vanished.\nCALPURNIA\nCaesar, I never stood on ceremonies,\nYet now they fright me. There is one within,\nBesides the things that we have heard and seen,\nRecounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.\nA lioness hath whelped in the streets;\nAnd graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;\nFierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,\nIn ranks and squadrons and right form of war,\nWhich drizzled blood upon the Capitol;\nThe noise of battle hurtled in the air,\nHorses did neigh, and dying men did groan,\nAnd ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.\nO Caesar! these things are beyond all use,\nAnd I do fear them.\nCAESAR\nWhat can be avoided\nWhose end is purposed by the mighty gods?\nYet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions\nAre to the world in general as to Caesar.\nCALPURNIA\nWhen beggars die, there are no comets seen;\nThe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\nCAESAR\nCowards die many times before their deaths;\nThe valiant never taste of death but once.\nOf all the wonders that I yet have heard.\nIt seems to me most strange that men should fear;\nSeeing that death, a necessary end,\nWill come when it will come.\nRe-enter Servant\nWhat say the augurers?\nServant\nThey would not have you to stir forth to-day.\nPlucking the entrails of an offering forth,\nThey could not find a heart within the beast.\nCAESAR\nThe gods do this in shame of cowardice:\nCaesar should be a beast without a heart,\nIf he should stay at home to-day for fear.\nNo, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well\nThat Caesar is more dangerous than he:\nWe are two lions litter'd in one day,\nAnd I the elder and more terrible:\nAnd Caesar shall go forth.\nCALPURNIA\nAlas, my lord,\nYour wisdom is consumed in confidence.\nDo not go forth to-day: call it my fear\nThat keeps you in the house, and not your own.\nWe'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:\nAnd he shall say you are not well to-day:\nLet me, upon my knee, prevail in this.\nCAESAR\nMark Antony shall say I am not well,\nAnd, for thy humour, I will stay at home.\nEnter DECIUS BRUTUS\nHere's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nCaesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:\nI come to fetch you to the senate-house.\nCAESAR\nAnd you are come in very happy time,\nTo bear my greeting to the senators\nAnd tell them that I will not come to-day:\nCannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:\nI will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.\nCALPURNIA\nSay he is sick.\nCAESAR\nShall Caesar send a lie?\nHave I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,\nTo be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?\nDecius, go tell them Caesar will not come.\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nMost mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,\nLest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.\nCAESAR\nThe cause is in my will: I will not come;\nThat is enough to satisfy the senate.\nBut for your private satisfaction,\nBecause I love you, I will let you know:\nCalpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:\nShe dreamt to-night she saw my statua,\nWhich, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,\nDid run pure blood: and many lusty Romans\nCame smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:\nAnd these does she apply for warnings, and portents,\nAnd evils imminent; and on her knee\nHath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nThis dream is all amiss interpreted;\nIt was a vision fair and fortunate:\nYour statue spouting blood in many pipes,\nIn which so many smiling Romans bathed,\nSignifies that from you great Rome shall suck\nReviving blood, and that great men shall press\nFor tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.\nThis by Calpurnia's dream is signified.\nCAESAR\nAnd this way have you well expounded it.\nDECIUS BRUTUS\nI have, when you have heard what I can say:\nAnd know it now: the senate have concluded\nTo give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.\nIf you shall send them word you will not come,\nTheir minds may change. Besides, it were a mock\nApt to be render'd, for some one to say\n'Break up the senate till another time,\nWhen Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'\nIf Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper\n'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?\nPardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love\nTo our proceeding bids me tell you this;\nAnd reason to my love is liable.\nCAESAR\nHow foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!\nI am ashamed I did yield to them.\nGive me my robe, for I will go.\nEnter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA\nAnd look where Publius is come to fetch me.\nPUBLIUS\nGood morrow, Caesar.\nCAESAR\nWelcome, Publius.\nWhat, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?\nGood morrow, Casca.

I charge thee, speak!\nExit Ghost\nMARCELLUS\n'Tis gone, and will not answer.\nBERNARDO\nHow now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:\nIs not this something more than fantasy?\nWhat think you on't?\nHORATIO\nBefore my God, I might not this believe\nWithout the sensible and true avouch\nOf mine own eyes.\nMARCELLUS\nIs it not like the king?\nHORATIO\nAs thou art to thyself:\nSuch was the very armour he had on\nWhen he the ambitious Norway combated;\nSo frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\n'Tis strange.\nMARCELLUS\nThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\nHORATIO\nIn what particular thought to work I know not;\nBut in the gross and scope of my opinion,\nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\nMARCELLUS\nGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\nWhy this same strict and most observant watch\nSo nightly toils the subject of the land,\nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon,\nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week;\nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste\nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:\nWho is't that can inform me?\nHORATIO\nThat can I;\nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,\nWhose image even but now appear'd to us,\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--\nFor so this side of our known world esteem'd him--\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror:\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\nHad he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,\nAnd carriage of the article design'd,\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\nHath in the skirts of Norway here and there\nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other--\nAs it doth well appear unto our state--\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\nThe source of this our watch and the chief head\nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\nBERNARDO\nI think it be no other but e'en so:\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\nComes armed through our watch; so like the king\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\nHORATIO\nA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.--\nBut soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!\nRe-enter Ghost\nI'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\nSpeak to me:\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\nThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,\nSpeak to me:\nCock crows\nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\nSpeak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.\nMARCELLUS\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\nHORATIO\nDo, if it will not stand.\nBERNARDO\n'Tis here!\nHORATIO\n'Tis here!\nMARCELLUS\n'Tis gone!\nExit Ghost\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\nTo offer it the show of violence;\nFor it is, as the air, invulnerable,\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\nBERNARDO\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\nHORATIO\nAnd then it started like a guilty thing\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard,\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\nAwake the god of day; and, at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies\nTo his confine: and of the truth herein\nThis present object made probation.\nMARCELLUS\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long:\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;\nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\nHORATIO\nSo have I heard and do in part believe it.\nBut, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice,\nLet us impart what we have seen to-night\nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\nMARCELLUS\nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\nExeunt\nSCENE II. A room of state in the castle.\n\nEnter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants\nKING CLAUDIUS\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\nTo bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe,\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\nThe imperial jointress to this warlike state,\nHave we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--\nWith an auspicious and a dropping eye,\nWith mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole,--\nTaken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\nNow follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth,\nOr thinking by our late dear brother's death\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\nColleagued with the dream of his advantage,\nHe hath not fail'd to pester us with message,\nImporting the surrender of those lands\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\nTo our most valiant brother. So much for him.\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting:\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\nOf this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress\nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,\nThe lists and full proportions, are all made\nOut of his subject: and we here dispatch\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway;\nGiving to you no further personal power\nTo business with the king, more than the scope\nOf these delated articles allow.\nFarewell, and let your haste commend your duty.\nCORNELIUS VOLTIMAND\nIn that and all things will we show our duty.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.\nExeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS\nAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?\nYou told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\nAnd loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\nLAERTES\nMy dread lord,\nYour leave and favour to return to France;\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark,\nTo show my duty in your coronation,\nYet now, I must confess, that duty done,\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?\nLORD POLONIUS\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\nBy laboursome petition, and at last\nUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent:\nI do beseech you, give him leave to go.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--\nHAMLET\n[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\nHAMLET\nNot so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust:\nThou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,\nPassing through nature to eternity.\nHAMLET\nAy, madam, it is common.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nIf it be,\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\nHAMLET\nSeems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\nNor windy suspiration of forced breath,\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\nNor the dejected 'havior of the visage,\nTogether with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,\nThat can denote me truly: these indeed seem,\nFor they are actions that a man might play:\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\nKING CLAUDIUS\n'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\nTo give these mourning duties to your father:\nBut, you must know, your father lost a father;\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\nIn filial obligation for some term\nTo do obsequious sorrow: but to persever\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\nOf impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\nAn understanding simple and unschool'd:\nFor what we know must be and is as common\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\nTake it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\nTo reason most absurd: whose common theme\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\nFrom the first corse till he that died to-day,\n'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth\nThis unprevailing woe, and think of us\nAs of a father: for let the world take note,\nYou are the most immediate to our throne;\nAnd with no less nobility of love\nThan that which dearest father bears his son,\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remain\nHere, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:\nI pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\nHAMLET\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:\nBe as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;\nThis gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet\nSits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\nAnd the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\nExeunt all but HAMLET\nHAMLET\nO, that this too too solid flesh would melt\nThaw and resolve itself into a dew!\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix'd\nHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!\nHow weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\nFie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\nBut two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:\nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\nMust I remember? why, she would hang on him,\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\nBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month--\nLet me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\nWith which she follow'd my poor father's body,\nLike Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--\nO, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,\nWould have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,\nMy father's brother, but no more like my father\nThan I to Hercules: within a month:\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\nIt is not nor it cannot come to good:\nBut break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.\nEnter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO\nHORATIO\nHail to your lordship!\nHAMLET\nI am glad to see you well:\nHoratio,--or I do forget myself.\nHORATIO\nThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\nHAMLET\nSir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?\nMARCELLUS\nMy good lord--\nHAMLET\nI am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\nHORATIO\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\nHAMLET\nI would not hear your enemy say so,\nNor shall you do mine ear that violence,\nTo make it truster of your own report\nAgainst yourself: I know you are no truant.\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\nWe'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\nHORATIO\nMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.\nHAMLET\nI pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;\nI think it was to see my mother's wedding.\nHORATIO\nIndeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.\nHAMLET\nThrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats\nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven\nOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!\nMy father!--methinks I see my father.\nHORATIO\nWhere, my lord?\nHAMLET\nIn my mind's eye, Horatio.\nHORATIO\nI saw him once; he was a goodly king.\nHAMLET\nHe was a man, take him for all in all,\nI shall not look upon his like again.\nHORATIO\nMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\nHAMLET\nSaw? who?\nHORATIO\nMy lord, the king your father.\nHAMLET\nThe king my father!\nHORATIO\nSeason your admiration for awhile\nWith an attent ear, till I may deliver,\nUpon the witness of these gentlemen,\nThis marvel to you.\nHAMLET\nFor God's love, let me hear.\nHORATIO\nTwo nights together had these gentlemen,\nMarcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,\nIn the dead vast and middle of the night,\nBeen thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,\nArmed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,\nAppears before them, and with solemn march\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd\nBy their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,\nWithin his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\nStand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did;\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch;\nWhere, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\nThe apparition comes: I knew your father;\nThese hands are not more like.\nHAMLET\nBut where was this?\nMARCELLUS\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.\nHAMLET\nDid you not speak to it?\nHORATIO\nMy lord, I did;\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\nIt lifted up its head and did address\nItself to motion, like as it would speak;\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\nAnd vanish'd from our sight.\nHAMLET\n'Tis very strange.\nHORATIO\nAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\nTo let you know of it.\nHAMLET\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\nHold you the watch to-night?\nMARCELLUS BERNARDO\nWe do, my lord.\nHAMLET\nArm'd, say you?\nMARCELLUS BERNARDO\nArm'd, my lord.\nHAMLET\nFrom top to toe?\nMARCELLUS BERNARDO\nMy lord, from head to foot.\nHAMLET\nThen saw you not his face?\nHORATIO\nO, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.\nHAMLET\nWhat, look'd he frowningly?\nHORATIO\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\nHAMLET\nPale or red?\nHORATIO\nNay, very pale.\nHAMLET\nAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?\nHORATIO\nMost constantly.\nHAMLET\nI would I had been there.\nHORATIO\nIt would have much amazed you.\nHAMLET\nVery like, very like. Stay'd it long?\nHORATIO\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\nMARCELLUS BERNARDO\nLonger, longer.\nHORATIO\nNot when I saw't.\nHAMLET\nHis beard was grizzled--no?\nHORATIO\nIt was, as I have seen it in his life,\nA sable silver'd.\nHAMLET\nI will watch to-night;\nPerchance 'twill walk again.\nHORATIO\nI warrant it will.\nHAMLET\nIf it assume my noble father's person,\nI'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\nIf you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\nAnd whatsoever else shall hap to-night,\nGive it an understanding, but no tongue:\nI will requite your loves. So, fare you well:\nUpon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,\nI'll visit you.\nAll\nOur duty to your honour.\nHAMLET\nYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.\nExeunt all but HAMLET\nMy father's spirit in arms! all is not well;\nI doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\nTill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,\nThough all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.\nExit\nSCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.\n\nEnter LAERTES and OPHELIA\nLAERTES\nMy necessaries are embark'd: farewell:\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\nBut let me hear from you.\nOPHELIA\nDo you doubt that?\nLAERTES\nFor Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood,\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.\nOPHELIA\nNo more but so?\nLAERTES\nThink it no more;\nFor nature, crescent, does not grow alone\nIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\nThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\nHe may not, as unvalued persons do,\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\nThe safety and health of this whole state;\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscribed\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\nAs he in his particular act and place\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain,\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough,\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon:\nVirtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring,\nToo oft before their buttons be disclosed,\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\nBe wary then; best safety lies in fear:\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\nOPHELIA\nI shall the effect of this good lesson keep,\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\nWhiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\nAnd recks not his own rede.\nLAERTES\nO, fear me not.\nI stay too long: but here my father comes.\nEnter POLONIUS\nA double blessing is a double grace,\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\nLORD POLONIUS\nYet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\nAnd you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\nSee thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\nNor any unproportioned thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\nGrapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\nOf each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel, but being in,\nBear't that the opposed may beware of thee.\nGive every man thy ear, but few thy voice;\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man,\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be;\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine ownself be true,\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee!\nLAERTES\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\nThe time invites you; go; your servants tend.\nLAERTES\nFarewell, Ophelia; and remember well\nWhat I have said to you.\nOPHELIA\n'Tis in my memory lock'd,\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\nLAERTES\nFarewell.\nExit\nLORD POLONIUS\nWhat is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?\nOPHELIA\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\nLORD POLONIUS\nMarry, well bethought:\n'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous:\nIf it be so, as so 'tis put on me,\nAnd that in way of caution, I must tell you,\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\nAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.\nWhat is between you? give me up the truth.\nOPHELIA\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\nOf his affection to me.\nLORD POLONIUS\nAffection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\nDo you believe his tenders, as you call them?\nOPHELIA\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\nLORD POLONIUS\nMarry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;\nThat you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\nOr--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\nRunning it thus--you'll tender me a fool.\nOPHELIA\nMy lord, he hath importuned me with love\nIn honourable fashion.\nLORD POLONIUS\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\nOPHELIA\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\nLORD POLONIUS\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both,\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\nBe somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him, that he is young\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\nThan may be given you: in few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,\nHave you so slander any moment leisure,\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\nLook to't, I charge you: come your ways.\nOPHELIA\nI shall obey, my lord.\nExeunt\nSCENE IV. The platform.\n\nEnter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS\nHAMLET\nThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.\nHORATIO\nIt is a nipping and an eager air.\nHAMLET\nWhat hour now?\nHORATIO\nI think it lacks of twelve.\nHAMLET\nNo, it is struck.\nHORATIO\nIndeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season\nWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\nA flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within\nWhat does this mean, my lord?\nHAMLET\nThe king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,\nKeeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;\nAnd, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\nThe kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out\nThe triumph of his pledge.\nHORATIO\nIs it a custom?\nHAMLET\nAy, marry, is't:\nBut to my mind, though I am native here\nAnd to the manner born, it is a custom\nMore honour'd in the breach than the observance.\nThis heavy-headed revel east and west\nMakes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:\nThey clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase\nSoil our addition; and indeed it takes\nFrom our achievements, though perform'd at height,\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\nSo, oft it chances in particular men,\nThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,\nAs, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,\nSince nature cannot choose his origin--\nBy the o'ergrowth of some complexion,\nOft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,\nOr by some habit that too much o'er-leavens\nThe form of plausive manners, that these men,\nCarrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\nBeing nature's livery, or fortune's star,--\nTheir virtues else--be they as pure as grace,\nAs infinite as man may undergo--\nShall in the general censure take corruption\nFrom that particular fault: the dram of eale\nDoth all the noble substance of a doubt\nTo his own scandal.\nHORATIO\nLook, my lord, it comes!\nEnter Ghost\nHAMLET\nAngels and ministers of grace defend us!\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\nThou comest in such a questionable shape\nThat I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,\nKing, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!\nLet me not burst in ignorance; but tell\nWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,\nHave burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,\nWherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,\nHath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,\nTo cast thee up again. What may this mean,\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel\nRevisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,\nMaking night hideous; and we fools of nature\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\nSay, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?\nGhost beckons HAMLET\nHORATIO\nIt beckons you to go away with it,\nAs if it some impartment did desire\nTo you alone.\nMARCELLUS\nLook, with what courteous action\nIt waves you to a more removed ground:\nBut do not go with it.\nHORATIO\nNo, by no means.\nHAMLET\nIt will not speak; then I will follow it.\nHORATIO\nDo not, my lord.\nHAMLET\nWhy, what should be the fear?\nI do not set my life in a pin's fee;\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\nIt waves me forth again: I'll follow it.\nHORATIO\nWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,\nOr to the dreadful summit of the cliff\nThat beetles o'er his base into the sea,\nAnd there assume some other horrible form,\nWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reason\nAnd draw you into madness? think of it:\nThe very place puts toys of desperation,\nWithout more motive, into every brain\nThat looks so many fathoms to the sea\nAnd hears it roar beneath.\nHAMLET\nIt waves me still.\nGo on; I'll follow thee.\nMARCELLUS\nYou shall not go, my lord.\nHAMLET\nHold off your hands.\nHORATIO\nBe ruled; you shall not go.\nHAMLET\nMy fate cries out,\nAnd makes each petty artery in this body\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.\nStill am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.\nBy heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!\nI say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.\nExeunt Ghost and HAMLET\nHORATIO\nHe waxes desperate with imagination.\nMARCELLUS\nLet's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.\nHORATIO\nHave after. To what issue will this come?\nMARCELLUS\nSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.\nHORATIO\nHeaven will direct it.\nMARCELLUS\nNay, let's follow him.\nExeunt\nSCENE V. Another part of the platform.\n\nEnter GHOST and HAMLET\nHAMLET\nWhere wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.\nGhost\nMark me.\nHAMLET\nI will.\nGhost\nMy hour is almost come,\nWhen I to sulphurous and tormenting flames\nMust render up myself.\nHAMLET\nAlas, poor ghost!\nGhost\nPity me not, but lend thy serious hearing\nTo what I shall unfold.\nHAMLET\nSpeak; I am bound to hear.\nGhost\nSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.\nHAMLET\nWhat?\nGhost\nI am thy father's spirit,\nDoom'd for a certain term to walk the night,\nAnd for the day confined to fast in fires,\nTill the foul crimes done in my days of nature\nAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid\nTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\nMake thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,\nThy knotted and combined locks to part\nAnd each particular hair to stand on end,\nLike quills upon the fretful porpentine:\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love--\nHAMLET\nO God!\nGhost\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\nHAMLET\nMurder!\nGhost\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is;\nBut this most foul, strange and unnatural.\nHAMLET\nHaste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love,\nMay sweep to my revenge.\nGhost\nI find thee apt;\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\nThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:\n'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\nIs by a forged process of my death\nRankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life\nNow wears his crown.\nHAMLET\nO my prophetic soul! My uncle!\nGhost\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--\nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\nSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:\nO Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\nI made to her in marriage, and to decline\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\nTo those of mine!\nBut virtue, as it never will be moved,\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed,\nAnd prey on garbage.\nBut, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\nThe leperous distilment; whose effect\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,\nAnd with a sudden vigour doth posset\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\nThe thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;\nAnd a most instant tetter bark'd about,\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,\nAll my smooth body.\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand\nOf life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:\nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account\nWith all my imperfections on my head:\nO, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\nBut, howsoever thou pursuest this act,\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\nAgainst thy mother aught: leave her to heaven\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\nThe glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\nAnd 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:\nAdieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.\nExit\nHAMLET\nO all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?\nAnd shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee!\nYea, from the table of my memory\nI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\nThat youth and observation copied there;\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\nUnmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!\nO most pernicious woman!\nO villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\nMy tables,--meet it is I set it down,\nThat one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;\nAt least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:\nWriting\nSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;\nIt is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'\nI have sworn 't.\nMARCELLUS HORATIO\n[Within] My lord, my lord,--\nMARCELLUS\n[Within] Lord Hamlet,--\nHORATIO\n[Within] Heaven secure him!\nHAMLET\nSo be it!\nHORATIO\n[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!\nHAMLET\nHillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.\nEnter HORATIO and MARCELLUS\nMARCELLUS\nHow is't, my noble lord?\nHORATIO\nWhat news, my lord?\nHAMLET\nO, wonderful!\nHORATIO\nGood my lord, tell it.\nHAMLET\nNo; you'll reveal it.\nHORATIO\nNot I, my lord, by heaven.\nMARCELLUS\nNor I, my lord.\nHAMLET\nHow say you, then; would heart of man once think it?\nBut you'll be secret?\nHORATIO MARCELLUS\nAy, by heaven, my lord.\nHAMLET\nThere's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark\nBut he's an arrant knave.\nHORATIO\nThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\nTo tell us this.\nHAMLET\nWhy, right; you are i' the right;\nAnd so, without more circumstance at all,\nI hold it fit that we shake hands and part:\nYou, as your business and desire shall point you;\nFor every man has business and desire,\nSuch as it is; and for mine own poor part,\nLook you, I'll go pray.\nHORATIO\nThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\nHAMLET\nI'm sorry they offend you, heartily;\nYes, 'faith heartily.\nHORATIO\nThere's no offence, my lord.\nHAMLET\nYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\nAnd much offence too. Touching this vision here,\nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\nO'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,\nAs you are friends, scholars and soldiers,\nGive me one poor request.\nHORATIO\nWhat is't, my lord? we will.\nHAMLET\nNever make known what you have seen to-night.\nHORATIO MARCELLUS\nMy lord, we will not.\nHAMLET\nNay, but swear't.\nHORATIO\nIn faith,\nMy lord, not I.\nMARCELLUS\nNor I, my lord, in faith.\nHAMLET\nUpon my sword.\nMARCELLUS\nWe have sworn, my lord, already.\nHAMLET\nIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.\nGhost\n[Beneath] Swear.\nHAMLET\nAh, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,\ntruepenny?\nCome on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--\nConsent to swear.\nHORATIO\nPropose the oath, my lord.\nHAMLET\nNever to speak of this that you have seen,\nSwear by my sword.\nGhost\n[Beneath] Swear.\nHAMLET\nHic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.\nCome hither, gentlemen,\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword:\nNever to speak of this that you have heard,\nSwear by my sword.\nGhost\n[Beneath] Swear.\nHAMLET\nWell said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?\nA worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\nHORATIO\nO day and night, but this is wondrous strange!\nHAMLET\nAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,\nAs I perchance hereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on,\nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\nWith arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\nAs 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'\nOr 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'\nOr such ambiguous giving out, to note\nThat you know aught of me: this not to do,\nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.\nGhost\n[Beneath] Swear.\nHAMLET\nRest, rest, perturbed spirit!\nThey swear\nSo, gentlemen,\nWith all my love I do commend me to you:\nAnd what so poor a man as Hamlet is\nMay do, to express his love and friending to you,\nGod willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;\nAnd still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\nThe time is out of joint: O cursed spite,\nThat ever I was born to set it right!\nNay, come, let's go together.\nExeunt\n\nACT II\nSCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.\n\nEnter POLONIUS and REYNALDO\nLORD POLONIUS\nGive him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.\nREYNALDO\nI will, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\nYou shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,\nBefore you visit him, to make inquire\nOf his behavior.\nREYNALDO\nMy lord, I did intend it.\nLORD POLONIUS\nMarry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,\nInquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\nAnd how, and who, what means, and where they keep,\nWhat company, at what expense; and finding\nBy this encompassment and drift of question\nThat they do know my son, come you more nearer\nThan your particular demands will touch it:\nTake you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;\nAs thus, 'I know his father and his friends,\nAnd in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?\nREYNALDO\nAy, very well, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\n'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:\nBut, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;\nAddicted so and so:' and there put on him\nWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rank\nAs may dishonour him; take heed of that;\nBut, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips\nAs are companions noted and most known\nTo youth and liberty.\nREYNALDO\nAs gaming, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\nAy, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,\nDrabbing: you may go so far.\nREYNALDO\nMy lord, that would dishonour him.\nLORD POLONIUS\n'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge\nYou must not put another scandal on him,\nThat he is open to incontinency;\nThat's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly\nThat they may seem the taints of liberty,\nThe flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\nA savageness in unreclaimed blood,\nOf general assault.\nREYNALDO\nBut, my good lord,--\nLORD POLONIUS\nWherefore should you do this?\nREYNALDO\nAy, my lord,\nI would know that.\nLORD POLONIUS\nMarry, sir, here's my drift;\nAnd I believe, it is a fetch of wit:\nYou laying these slight sullies on my son,\nAs 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,\nYour party in converse, him you would sound,\nHaving ever seen in the prenominate crimes\nThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assured\nHe closes with you in this consequence;\n'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'\nAccording to the phrase or the addition\nOf man and country.\nREYNALDO\nVery good, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\nAnd then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I\nabout to say? By the mass, I was about to say\nsomething: where did I leave?\nREYNALDO\nAt 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'\nand 'gentleman.'\nLORD POLONIUS\nAt 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;\nHe closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;\nI saw him yesterday, or t' other day,\nOr then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,\nThere was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;\nThere falling out at tennis:' or perchance,\n'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'\nVidelicet, a brothel, or so forth.\nSee you now;\nYour bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:\nAnd thus do we of wisdom and of reach,\nWith windlasses and with assays of bias,\nBy indirections find directions out:\nSo by my former lecture and advice,\nShall you my son. You have me, have you not?\nREYNALDO\nMy lord, I have.\nLORD POLONIUS\nGod be wi' you; fare you well.\nREYNALDO\nGood my lord!\nLORD POLONIUS\nObserve his inclination in yourself.\nREYNALDO\nI shall, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\nAnd let him ply his music.\nREYNALDO\nWell, my lord.\nLORD POLONIUS\nFarewell!\nExit REYNALDO\nEnter OPHELIA\nHow now, Ophelia! what's the matter?\nOPHELIA\nO, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!\nLORD POLONIUS\nWith what, i' the name of God?\nOPHELIA\nMy lord, as I was sewing in my closet,\nLord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;\nNo hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,\nUngarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;\nPale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;\nAnd with a look so piteous in purport\nAs if he had been loosed out of hell\nTo speak of horrors,--he comes before me.\nLORD POLONIUS\nMad for thy love?\nOPHELIA\nMy lord, I do not know;\nBut truly, I do fear it.\nLORD POLONIUS\nWhat said he?\nOPHELIA\nHe took me by the wrist and held me hard;\nThen goes he to the length of all his arm;\nAnd, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,\nHe falls to such perusal of my face\nAs he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;\nAt last, a little shaking of mine arm\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\nHe raised a sigh so piteous and profound\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\nAnd end his being: that done, he lets me go:\nAnd, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,\nHe seem'd to find his way without his eyes;\nFor out o' doors he went without their helps,\nAnd, to the last, bended their light on me.\nLORD POLONIUS\nCome, go with me: I will go seek the king.\nThis is the very ecstasy of love,\nWhose violent property fordoes itself\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings\nAs oft as any passion under heaven\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\nOPHELIA\nNo, my good lord, but, as you did command,\nI did repel his fetters and denied\nHis access to me.\nLORD POLONIUS\nThat hath made him mad.\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgment\nI had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,\nAnd meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!\nBy heaven, it is as proper to our age\nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\nAs it is common for the younger sort\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:\nThis must be known; which, being kept close, might\nmove\nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.\nExeunt\nSCENE II. A room in the castle.\n\nEnter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants\nKING CLAUDIUS\nWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!\nMoreover that we much did long to see you,\nThe need we have to use you did provoke\nOur hasty sending. Something have you heard\nOf Hamlet's transformation; so call it,\nSith nor the exterior nor the inward man\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\nMore than his father's death, that thus hath put him\nSo much from the understanding of himself,\nI cannot dream of: I entreat you both,\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him,\nAnd sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\nSome little time: so by your companies\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\nWhether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,\nThat, open'd, lies within our remedy.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;\nAnd sure I am two men there are not living\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\nTo show us so much gentry and good will\nAs to expend your time with us awhile,\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\nAs fits a king's remembrance.\nROSENCRANTZ\nBoth your majesties\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\nThan to entreaty.\nGUILDENSTERN\nBut we both obey,\nAnd here give up ourselves, in the full bent\nTo lay our service freely at your feet,\nTo be commanded.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\nMy too much changed son. Go, some of you,\nAnd bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.\nGUILDENSTERN\nHeavens make our presence and our practises\nPleasant and helpful to him!\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nAy, amen!\nExeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants\nEnter POLONIUS\nLORD POLONIUS\nThe ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,\nAre joyfully return'd.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nThou still hast been the father of good news.\nLORD POLONIUS\nHave I, my lord? I assure my good liege,\nI hold my duty, as I hold my soul,\nBoth to my God and to my gracious king:\nAnd I do think, or else this brain of mine\nHunts not the trail of policy so sure\nAs it hath used to do, that I have found\nThe very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nO, speak of that; that do I long to hear.\nLORD POLONIUS\nGive first admittance to the ambassadors;\nMy news shall be the fruit to that great feast.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nThyself do grace to them, and bring them in.\nExit POLONIUS\nHe tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found\nThe head and source of all your son's distemper.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nI doubt it is no other but the main;\nHis father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nWell, we shall sift him.\nRe-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS\nWelcome, my good friends!\nSay, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?\nVOLTIMAND\nMost fair return of greetings and desires.\nUpon our first, he sent out to suppress\nHis nephew's levies; which to him appear'd\nTo be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;\nBut, better look'd into, he truly found\nIt was against your highness: whereat grieved,\nThat so his sickness, age and impotence\nWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests\nOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;\nReceives rebuke from Norway, and in fine\nMakes vow before his uncle never more\nTo give the assay of arms against your majesty.\nWhereon old Norway, overcome with joy,\nGives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,\nAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,\nSo levied as before, against the Polack:\nWith an entreaty, herein further shown,\nGiving a paper\nThat it might please you to give quiet pass\nThrough your dominions for this enterprise,\nOn such regards of safety and allowance\nAs therein are set down.\nKING CLAUDIUS\nIt likes us well;\nAnd at our more consider'd time well read,\nAnswer, and think upon this business.\nMeantime we thank you for your well-took labour:\nGo to your rest; at night we'll feast together:\nMost welcome home!\nExeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS\n"]}
