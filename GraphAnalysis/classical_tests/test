But my worry persisted. I didn't want to admit that Bordurin, Prix de Rome, had made a mistake in his drawing. But this afternoon, turning the pages of an old collection of the Satirique Bouvillois, a blackmailsheet whose owner was accused of high treason during the war, I caught a glimpse of the truth. I went to the museum as soon as I left the library. I crossed the shadow of the vestibule quickly. My steps made no sound on the black and white tiles. A whole race of plaster folk twisted their arms. In passing I glanced, through two great openings, and saw cracked vases, plates, and a blue and yellow satyr on a pedestal. It was the Bernard Palissy Room, devoted to ceramics and minor arts. But ceramics do not amuse me. A lady and gentleman in mourning were respectfully contemplating the baked objects. Above the entrance to the main hall--the Salon Bordurin-Renaudas--someone had hung, undoubtedly only a little while ago, a large canvas which I did not recognize. It was signed by Richard Severand and entitled \"The Bachelor's Death.\" It was a gift of the State. Naked to the waist, his body a little green, like that of a dead man, the bachelor was lying on an unmade bed. The disorder of sheets and blankets attested to a long death agony. I smiled, thinking about M. Fasquelle. But he wasn't alone: his daughter was taking care of him. On the canvas, the maid, his mistress, her features marked by vice, had already opened a bureau drawer and was counting the money. An open door disclosed a man in a cap, a cigarette stuck to his lower lip, waiting in the shadows. Near the wall a cat lapped milk indifferently. This man had lived only for himself. By a harsh and well-deserved punishment, no one had come to his bedside to close his eyes. This painting gave me a last warning: there was still time, I could retrace my steps. But if I were to turn a deaf ear, I had been forewarned: more than a hundred and fifty portraits were hanging on the wall of the room I was about to enter; with the exception of a few young people, prematurely taken from their families, and the mother superior of a boarding school, none of those painted had died a bachelor, none of them had died childless or intestate, none without the last rites. Their souls at peace that day as on other days, with God and the world, these men had slipped quietly into death, to claim their share of eternal life to which they had a right. For they had a right to everything: to life, to work, to wealth, to command, to respect, and, finally, to immortality. I took a moment to compose myself and entered. A guardian was sleeping near the window. A pale light, falling from the windows, made flecks on the paintings. Nothing alive in this great rectangular room, except a cat who was frightened at my approach and fled. But I felt the looks of a hundred and fifty pairs of eyes on me. All who belonged to the Bouville elite between 1875 and 1910 were there, men and women, scrupulously painted by Renaudas and Bordurin. The men had built Sainte-Cecile-de-la-Mer. In 1882, they founded the Federation of Shipowners and Merchants of Bouville \"to group in one powerful entity all men of good will, to co-operate in national recovery and to hold in check the parties of disorder. . . .\" They made Bouville the best equipped port in France for unloading coal and wood. The lengthening and widening of the quays were their work. They extended the Marine Terminal and, by constant dredging, brought the low-tide depth of anchorage to 10.7 meters. In twenty years, the catch of the fishing fleet which was 5,000 barrels in 1869, rose, thanks to them, to 18,000 barrels. Stopping at no sacrifice to assist the improvement of the best elements in the working-class, they created, on their own initiative, various centres for technical and professional study which prospered under their lofty protection. They broke the famous shipping strike in 1898 and gave their sons to their country in 1914. The women, worthy helpmates of these strugglers, founded most of the town's charitable and philanthropic organizations. But above all, they were wives and mothers. They raised fine children, taught them rights and duties, religion, and a respect for the traditions which made France great. The general complexion of these portraits bordered on dark brown. Lively colours had been banished, out of decency. However, in the portraits of Renaudas, who showed a partiality towards old men, the snowy hair and sidewhiskers showed up well against deep black backgrounds; he excelled in painting hands. Bordurin, who was a little weak on theory, sacrificed the hands somewhat but the collars shone like white marble. It was very hot; the guardian was snoring gently. I glanced around the walls: I saw hands and eyes; here and there a spot of light obliterated a face. As I began walking towards the portrait of Olivier Blevigne, something held me back: from the moulding, Pacome, the merchant, cast a bright look down on me. He was standing there, his head thrown slightly back; in one hand he held a top hat and gloves against his pearl-grey trousers. I could not keep myself from a certain admiration: I saw nothing mediocre in him, nothing which allowed of criticism: small feet, slender hands, wide wrestler's shoulders, a hint of whimsy. He courteously offered visitors the unwrinkled purity of his face; the "],["N_Shakespear_Ceasar_P2.rtf","\nSCENE III.

Sirrah Claudius!\nTo VARRO\nFellow thou, awake!\nVARRO\nMy lord?\nCLAUDIUS\nMy lord?\nBRUTUS\nWhy did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?\nVARRO CLAUDIUS\nDid we, my lord?\nBRUTUS\nAy: saw you any thing?\nVARRO\nNo, my lord, I saw nothing.\nCLAUDIUS\nNor I, my lord.\nBRUTUS\nGo and commend me to my brother Cassius;\nBid him set on his powers betimes before,\nAnd we will follow.\nVARRO CLAUDIUS\nIt shall be done, my lord.\nExeunt\n\nACT V\nSCENE I. The plains of Philippi.\n\nEnter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army\nOCTAVIUS\nNow, Antony, our hopes are answered:\nYou said the enemy would not come down,\nBut keep the hills and upper regions;\nIt proves not so: their battles are at hand;\nThey mean to warn us at Philippi here,\nAnswering before we do demand of them.\nANTONY\nTut, I am in their bosoms, and I know\nWherefore they do it: they could be content\nTo visit other places; and come down\nWith fearful bravery, thinking by this face\nTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;\nBut 'tis not so.\nEnter a Messenger\nMessenger\nPrepare you, generals:\nThe enemy comes on in gallant show;\nTheir bloody sign of battle is hung out,\nAnd something to be done immediately.\nANTONY\nOctavius, lead your battle softly on,\nUpon the left hand of the even field.\nOCTAVIUS\nUpon the right hand I; keep thou the left.\nANTONY\nWhy do you cross me in this exigent?\nOCTAVIUS\nI do not cross you; but I will do so.\nMarch\nDrum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others\nBRUTUS\nThey stand, and would have parley.\nCASSIUS\nStand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.\nOCTAVIUS\nMark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?\nANTONY\nNo, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.\nMake forth; the generals would have some words.\nOCTAVIUS\nStir not until the signal.\nBRUTUS\nWords before blows: is it so, countrymen?\nOCTAVIUS\nNot that we love words better, as you do.\nBRUTUS\nGood words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.\nANTONY\nIn your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:\nWitness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,\nCrying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'\nCASSIUS\nAntony,\nThe posture of your blows are yet unknown;\nBut for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,\nAnd leave them honeyless.\nANTONY\nNot stingless too.\nBRUTUS\nO, yes, and soundless too;\nFor you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,\nAnd very wisely threat before you sting.\nANTONY\nVillains, you did not so, when your vile daggers\nHack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:\nYou show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,\nAnd bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;\nWhilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind\nStruck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!\nCASSIUS\nFlatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:\nThis tongue had not offended so to-day,\nIf Cassius might have ruled.\nOCTAVIUS\nCome, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,\nThe proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;\nI draw a sword against conspirators;\nWhen think you that the sword goes up again?\nNever, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds\nBe well avenged; or till another Caesar\nHave added slaughter to the sword of traitors.\nBRUTUS\nCaesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,\nUnless thou bring'st them with thee.\nOCTAVIUS\nSo I hope;\nI was not born to die on Brutus' sword.\nBRUTUS\nO, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,\nYoung man, thou couldst not die more honourable.\nCASSIUS\nA peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,\nJoin'd with a masker and a reveller!\nANTONY\nOld Cassius still!\nOCTAVIUS\nCome, Antony, away!\nDefiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:\nIf you dare fight to-day, come to the field;\nIf not, when you have stomachs.\nExeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army\nCASSIUS\nWhy, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!\nThe storm is up, and all is on the hazard.\nBRUTUS\nHo, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.\nLUCILIUS\n[Standing forth] My lord?\nBRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart\nCASSIUS\nMessala!\nMESSALA\n[Standing forth] What says my general?\nCASSIUS\nMessala,\nThis is my birth-day; as this very day\nWas Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:\nBe thou my witness that against my will,\nAs Pompey was, am I compell'd to set\nUpon one battle all our liberties.\nYou know that I held Epicurus strong\nAnd his opinion: now I change my mind,\nAnd partly credit things that do presage.\nComing from Sardis, on our former ensign\nTwo mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,\nGorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;\nWho to Philippi here consorted us:\nThis morning are they fled away and gone;\nAnd in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,\nFly o'er our heads and downward look on us,\nAs we were sickly prey: their shadows seem\nA canopy most fatal, under which\nOur army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\nMESSALA\nBelieve not so.\nCASSIUS\nI but believe it partly;\nFor I am fresh of spirit and resolved\nTo meet all perils very constantly.\nBRUTUS\nEven so, Lucilius.\nCASSIUS\nNow, most noble Brutus,\nThe gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,\nLovers in peace, lead on our days to age!\nBut since the affairs of men rest still incertain,\nLet's reason with the worst that may befall.\nIf we do lose this battle, then is this\nThe very last time we shall speak together:\nWhat are you then determined to do?\nBRUTUS\nEven by the rule of that philosophy\nBy which I did blame Cato for the death\nWhich he did give himself, I know not how,\nBut I do find it cowardly and vile,\nFor fear of what might fall, so to prevent\nThe time of life: arming myself with patience\nTo stay the providence of some high powers\nThat govern us below.\nCASSIUS\nThen, if we lose this battle,\nYou are contented to be led in triumph\nThorough the streets of Rome?\nBRUTUS\nNo, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,\nThat ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;\nHe bears too great a mind. But this same day\nMust end that work the ides of March begun;\nAnd whether we shall meet again I know not.\nTherefore our everlasting farewell take:\nFor ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!\nIf we do meet again, why, we shall smile;\nIf not, why then, this parting was well made.\nCASSIUS\nFor ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!\nIf we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;\nIf not, 'tis true this parting was well made.\nBRUTUS\nWhy, then, lead on. O, that a man might know\nThe end of this day's business ere it come!\nBut it sufficeth that the day will end,\nAnd then the end is known. Come, ho! away!\nExeunt\nSCENE II. The same. The field of battle.\n\nAlarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA\nBRUTUS\nRide, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills\nUnto the legions on the other side.\nLoud alarum\nLet them set on at once; for I perceive\nBut cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,\nAnd sudden push gives them the overthrow.\nRide, ride, Messala: let them all come down.\nExeunt\nSCENE III. Another part of the field.\n\nAlarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS\nCASSIUS\nO, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!\nMyself have to mine own turn'd enemy:\nThis ensign here of mine was turning back;\nI slew the coward, and did take it from him.\nTITINIUS\nO Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;\nWho, having some advantage on Octavius,\nTook it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,\nWhilst we by Antony are all enclosed.\nEnter PINDARUS\nPINDARUS\nFly further off, my lord, fly further off;\nMark Antony is in your tents, my lord\nFly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.\nCASSIUS\nThis hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;\nAre those my tents where I perceive the fire?\nTITINIUS\nThey are, my lord.\nCASSIUS\nTitinius, if thou lovest me,\nMount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,\nTill he have brought thee up to yonder troops,\nAnd here again; that I may rest assured\nWhether yond troops are friend or enemy.\nTITINIUS\nI will be here again, even with a thought.\nExit\nCASSIUS\nGo, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;\nMy sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,\nAnd tell me what thou notest about the field.\nPINDARUS ascends the hill\nThis day I breathed first: time is come round,\nAnd where I did begin, there shall I end;\nMy life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?\nPINDARUS\n[Above] O my lord!\nCASSIUS\nWhat news?\nPINDARUS\n[Above] Titinius is enclosed round about\nWith horsemen, that make to him on the spur;\nYet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.\nNow, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.\nHe's ta'en.\nShout\nAnd, hark! they shout for joy.\nCASSIUS\nCome down, behold no more.\nO, coward that I am, to live so long,\nTo see my best friend ta'en before my face!\nPINDARUS descends\nCome hither, sirrah:\nIn Parthia did I take thee prisoner;\nAnd then I swore thee, saving of thy life,\nThat whatsoever I did bid thee do,\nThou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;\nNow be a freeman: and with this good sword,\nThat ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.\nStand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;\nAnd, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,\nGuide thou the sword.\nPINDARUS stabs him\nCaesar, thou art revenged,\nEven with the sword that kill'd thee.\nDies\nPINDARUS\nSo, I am free; yet would not so have been,\nDurst I have done my will. O Cassius,\nFar from this country Pindarus shall run,\nWhere never Roman shall take note of him.\nExit\nRe-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA\nMESSALA\nIt is but change, Titinius; for Octavius\nIs overthrown by noble Brutus' power,\nAs Cassius' legions are by Antony.\nTITINIUS\nThese tidings will well comfort Cassius.\nMESSALA\nWhere did you leave him?\nTITINIUS\nAll disconsolate,\nWith Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.\nMESSALA\nIs not that he t hat lies upon the ground?\nTITINIUS\nHe lies not like the living. O my heart!\nMESSALA\nIs not that he?\nTITINIUS\nNo, this was he, Messala,\nBut Cassius is no more. O setting sun,\nAs in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,\nSo in his red blood Cassius' day is set;\nThe sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;\nClouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!\nMistrust of my success hath done this deed.\nMESSALA\nMistrust of good success hath done this deed.\nO hateful error, melancholy's child,\nWhy dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men\nThe things that are not? O error, soon conceived,\nThou never comest unto a happy birth,\nBut kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!\nTITINIUS\nWhat, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?\nMESSALA\nSeek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet\nThe noble Brutus, thrusting this report\nInto his ears; I may say, thrusting it;\nFor piercing steel and darts envenomed\nShall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus\nAs tidings of this sight.\nTITINIUS\nHie you, Messala,\nAnd I will seek for Pindarus the while.\nExit MESSALA\nWhy didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?\nDid I not meet thy friends? and did not they\nPut on my brows this wreath of victory,\nAnd bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?\nAlas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!\nBut, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;\nThy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I\nWill do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,\nAnd see how I regarded Caius Cassius.\nBy your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part\nCome, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.\nKills himself\nAlarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS\nBRUTUS\nWhere, where, Messala, doth his body lie?\nMESSALA\nLo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.\nBRUTUS\nTitinius' face is upward.\nCATO\nHe is slain.\nBRUTUS\nO Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!\nThy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords\nIn our own proper entrails.\nLow alarums\nCATO\nBrave Titinius!\nLook, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!\nBRUTUS\nAre yet two Romans living such as these?\nThe last of all the Romans, fare thee well!\nIt is impossible that ever Rome\nShould breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears\nTo this dead man than you shall see me pay.\nI shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.\nCome, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:\nHis funerals shall not be in our camp,\nLest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;\nAnd come, young Cato; let us to the field.\nLabeo and Flavius, set our battles on:\n'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night\nWe shall try fortune in a second fight.\nExeunt\nSCENE IV. Another part of the field.\n\nAlarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others\nBRUTUS\nYet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!\nCATO\nWhat bastard doth not? Who will go with me?\nI will proclaim my name about the field:\nI am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\nA foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;\nI am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\nBRUTUS\nAnd I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;\nBrutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!\nExit\nLUCILIUS\nO young and noble Cato, art thou down?\nWhy, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;\nAnd mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.\nFirst Soldier\nYield, or thou diest.\nLUCILIUS\nOnly I yield to die:\nThere is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;\nOffering money\nKill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.\nFirst Soldier\nWe must not. A noble prisoner!\nSecond Soldier\nRoom, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.\nFirst Soldier\nI'll tell the news. Here comes the general.\nEnter ANTONY\nBrutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.\nANTONY\nWhere is he?\nLUCILIUS\nSafe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:\nI dare assure thee that no enemy\nShall ever take alive the noble Brutus:\nThe gods defend him from so great a shame!\nWhen you do find him, or alive or dead,\nHe will be found like Brutus, like himself.\nANTONY\nThis is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,\nA prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;\nGive him all kindness: I had rather have\nSuch men my friends than enemies. Go on,\nAnd see whether Brutus be alive or dead;\nAnd bring us word unto Octavius' tent\nHow every thing is chanced.\nExeunt\nSCENE V. Another part of the field.\n\nEnter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS\nBRUTUS\nCome, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.\nCLITUS\nStatilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,\nHe came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.\nBRUTUS\nSit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;\nIt is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.\nWhispers\nCLITUS\nWhat, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.\nBRUTUS\nPeace then! no words.\nCLITUS\nI'll rather kill myself.\nBRUTUS\nHark thee, Dardanius.\nWhispers\nDARDANIUS\nShall I do such a deed?\nCLITUS\nO Dardanius!\nDARDANIUS\nO Clitus!\nCLITUS\nWhat ill request did Brutus make to thee?\nDARDANIUS\nTo kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.\nCLITUS\nNow is that noble vessel full of grief,\nThat it runs over even at his eyes.\nBRUTUS\nCome hither, good Volumnius; list a word.\nVOLUMNIUS\nWhat says my lord?\nBRUTUS\nWhy, this, Volumnius:\nThe ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me\nTwo several times by night; at Sardis once,\nAnd, this last night, here in Philippi fields:\nI know my hour is come.\nVOLUMNIUS\nNot so, my lord.\nBRUTUS\nNay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.\nThou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;\nOur enemies have beat us to the pit:\nLow alarums\nIt is more worthy to leap in ourselves,\nThan tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,\nThou know'st that we two went to school together:\nEven for that our love of old, I prithee,\nHold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.\nVOLUMNIUS\nThat's not an office for a friend, my lord.\nAlarum still\nCLITUS\nFly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.\nBRUTUS\nFarewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.\nStrato, thou hast been all this while asleep;\nFarewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,\nMy heart doth joy that yet in all my life\nI found no man but he was true to me.\nI shall have glory by this losing day\nMore than Octavius and Mark Antony\nBy this vile conquest shall attain unto.\nSo fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue\nHath almost ended his life's history:\nNight hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,\nThat have but labour'd to attain this hour.\nAlarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'\nCLITUS\nFly, my lord, fly.\nBRUTUS\nHence! I will follow.\nExeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS\nI prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:\nThou art a fellow of a good respect;\nThy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:\nHold then my sword, and turn away thy face,\nWhile I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?\nSTRATO\nGive me your hand first.

Strato, where is thy master?\nSTRATO\nFree from the bondage you are in, Messala:\nThe conquerors can but make a fire of him;\nFor Brutus only overcame himself,\nAnd no man else hath honour by his death.\nLUCILIUS\nSo Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,\nThat thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.\nOCTAVIUS\nAll that served Brutus, I will entertain them.\nFellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?\nSTRATO\nAy, if Messala will prefer me to you.\nOCTAVIUS\nDo so, good Messala.\nMESSALA\nHow died my master, Strato?\nSTRATO\nI held the sword, and he did run on it.\nMESSALA\nOctavius, then take him to follow thee,\nThat did the latest service to my master.\nANTONY\nThis was the noblest Roman of them all:\nAll the conspirators save only he\nDid that they did in envy of great Caesar;\nHe only, in a general honest thought\nAnd common good to all, made one of them.\nHis life was gentle, and the elements\nSo mix'd in him that Nature might stand up\nAnd say to all the world 'This was a man!'\nOCTAVIUS\nAccording to his virtue let us use him,\nWith all respect and rites of burial.\nWithin my tent his bones to-night shall lie,\nMost like a soldier, order'd honourably.\nSo call the field to rest; and let's away,\nTo part the glories of this happy day.\nExeunt\n"],["N_Shakespear_Hamlet_P2.rtf","LORD POLONIUS\nThis business is well ended.\nMy liege, and madam, to expostulate\nWhat majesty should be, what duty is,\nWhy day is day, night night, and time is time,\nWere nothing but to waste night, day and time.\nTherefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\nI will be brief: your noble son is mad:\nMad call I it; for, to define true madness,\nWhat is't but to be nothing else but mad?\nBut let that go.\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\nMore matter, with less art.\nLORD POLONIUS\nMadam, I swear I use no art at all.\nThat he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;\nAnd pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;\nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.\nMad let us grant him, then: and now remains\nThat we find out the cause of this effect,\nOr rather say, the cause of this defect,\nFor this effect defective comes by cause:\nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.
