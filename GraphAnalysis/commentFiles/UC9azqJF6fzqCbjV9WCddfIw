[["RadarSSBM", [150, "LOL yes I am glad we did not have to discuss that\u0003@Chickenbutt again if you\u2019re just starting out, or using it mostly for voiceover it\u2019s not the biggest deal\u2026but if you\u2019re doing vocals for music I think it\u2019s more important.<br><br>In general with musical recording especially, the goal is often to get a fairly \u201cdry\u201d signal, then add things like reverb back in through effects etc. The idea is that an untreated room kinda sucks, so you\u2019re kinda going for a sound that\u2019s less affected by the room. In contrast to some pro studios, where they might have cool natural reverb/acoustics\u0003None of the audio in this video is edited, outside of me removing any pauses etc, but nothing affecting sound. This was intentional to show off the sound of the mic.<br><br>Usually I do use some EQ and stuff to clean things up a little with my main mic (a shure SM57 going into a Focusrite 2i2)<br><br>I think if your budget is low, it might not be a bad option for vocals, but it really depends on what you\u2019re looking for! I personally haven\u2019t used it for that so I can\u2019t vouch for it as confidently as I can for general dialogue. I do think in general if you know what you\u2019re doing on the production side of things, you can always make a mic sound nicer than it does out of the box. <br><br>One thing worth mentioning with all mics is this: the room you\u2019re in will have just as big an impact as the mic will. If you do vocals/dialogue and it sounds too reverb-y you can literally try recording with a thick blanket over your head\u2026crazy\u2026but it works! I don\u2019t do this personally, but I am probably gonna look into getting some kind of acoustic treatment eventually just to dampen the reverb in the room. Basic stuff like a thick carpet/bookshelves can help too.\u0003Short answer is that it\u2019s hard to execute and the increased speed often doesn\u2019t make a difference. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s a very fast option, it\u2019s just that a turn around wavedash back is fast enough in most situations <br><br>Longer answer: it\u2019s technically not the fastest either as doing a wavedash forward turn around (basically a PC drop out of wavedash forward near ledge) is faster and arguably easier to execute. Even then, this is assuming you\u2019re far from the edge and not already facing backwards, as the shine turn around is only a good option because it allows you to turn around quickly (so if you\u2019re already facing the right direction you can just wavedash)<br><br>There\u2019s a lot of hard stuff to learn in melee, and (at least imo) grinding something like ledgedashes would be way way more useful than speeding up your ledge grabs by like 5-10 frames in specific situations.\u0003@Darrow25 probably a bug with the alpha build? Could try on the older version, 2.0 (which is what I linked in description). Also check to see if UP has an updated version for download on his patreon. If I recall correctly I seemed to have a similar problem using the newer version\u0003What version do you have?\u0003Thabks\u0003Fox double lasers are actually pretty bad! They\u2019re a lot slower than single lasers, which leave you vulnerable in a lot of situations. They\u2019re pretty overrated overall and while they can be good in some matchups, I don\u2019t think you should focus on practicing them\u0003He mentions TK/EE/Coney specifically in the episode, so I think that\u2019s who he is referring to\u0003Glad to hear you enjoyed it! I know this episode was really long haha we tried to keep it as short as we could\u0003I think clueless is a bit too strong but I agree with the overall point that you need to be connecting with the average fan!\u0003@Dwit Beathead no worries!\u0003It\u2019s answered in the video, preorders are starting back up in June!\u0003Asking the important questions I see\u0003Should be coming sometime in the summer!\u0003I knew I was forgetting something hahaha, thanks!\u0003I mean, we already know why LOL\u0003Very possible! <br><br>For what it\u2019s worth, I think entering tournaments is very valuable experience. People simply play different in tourney and the pressure is different. Because of that, you\u2019ll probably improve more quickly if you enter stuff.<br><br>In can also be useful to get used to entering events so that when you do enter one you\u2019re serious about, the nerves don\u2019t get to you. <br><br>All that being said, if you don\u2019t feel ready or don\u2019t find the idea fun, it\u2019s fine to wait too! melee should be fun after all\u0003Yeah it\u2019s pretty terrible. Wasn\u2019t aware of it ahead of time unfortunately\u0003Yup, I\u2019ve already submitted it so it might take a day to process\u0003We had some audio issues and visual issues this week. We&#39;re working on trying to fix them moving forward!\u0003Do you mean shine turn-around wavedash back?<br><br>Realistically speaking most of the options are very comparable but the fastest option possible is technically for Fox is run to the ledge wavedash forward turn around. <br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/62IDrqxCAPc\">https://youtu.be/62IDrqxCAPc</a><br><br>This video does a decent job comparing them. As you can see, most of them are pretty comparable speed wise (for example shine turn around is 1 frame slower, but still very fast). In the majority of situations, a wavedash back is fine for most characters lol\u0003It\u2019s not so much intentional as it is a lack of knowledge!\u0003Me too \ud83d\ude2d<br><br>Hard not to think about how many videos I\u2019d have done if I never got into that car accident three years ago\u0003I totally get where you\u2019re coming from, and I should make it clear that nothing is off limits in terms of what to learn in melee.<br><br>What\u2019s important to remember though is if you are someone who is trying to get as good as you can as quickly as possible, there\u2019s gonna be stuff that\u2019s worth learning/practicing, and stuff that\u2019s not. Certain techniques will produce far less of a boost in skill than others.<br><br>So when I say \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend it to a beginner\u201d I\u2019m saying \u201cfocus on this first, you\u2019ll notice a much bigger improvement\u201d\u0003I considered doing a section on shield pivots, probably will be in a part 2 if I make one. Important thing to remember is that if I covered everything in the comments, the video would be over 20 minutes long lol\u0003The main issue is that they got way worse after I had a brain injury from a car accident a few years back. I\u2019ve made a bunch of progress in recovering from that since then, but it made my migraines SO much worse, and that aspect of recovery has still been very slow and challenging. <br><br>Definitely the difference between something that was an annoying part of my life to a full on disability at the moment\u0003I said much extra speed, meaning it is faster. In a lot of situations, a couple frames of speed won\u2019t always make a huge difference, so since my videos generally target mid level players, I think there are SOOO many more useful things you can learn than speeding up your ledge grab tech by a fraction of time. <br><br>However, I still wanted to highlight different options so that players who are looking for something new still get something out of watching the video. <br><br>If you watch competitive sets, most of the time they grab ledge with quick wave dashes anyway!\u0003You can literally see the inputs on screen of me doing it lol?? You can\u2019t JC their up b as far as I\u2019m aware, but I just don\u2019t get how you could have this opinion with inputs visible on screen lol\u0003Can you grab ledge purely out of the super wavedash or do you have to turn around and grapple too? I genuinely wasn\u2019t sure if Samus could do it or not. I can super wavedash, but it didn\u2019t seem like it would set up ledge grab but i am def not a Samus player lol.\u0003I was thinking about this one, and including shield pivot into + wavedash out of shield back to ledge. It ended up not making the cut but mostly because I wanted to keep the video short\u0003@Drill_Dr_ILL I think you\u2019re just bad at them haha, practice it with Luigi first and check the inputs in this video to see if you are doing something wrong! It\u2019s def not something everyone can do immediately\u0003I should\u2019ve mentioned this, but controllers can make a difference with how difficult a PC drop is! Try it with a different controller to see if that helps!\u0003Great point!\u0003Gotta get a snap back mod!!\u0003No, Hbox definitely did the correct thing there. The point wasn&#39;t supposed to be &quot;look Hbox is doing the wrong thing&quot; it&#39;s just an example of how edge grabbing quickly is important. <br><br>When I referred to experienced players, I didn&#39;t mean pros, I meant people like myself who have been playing for years, but could still work on practicing certain quick options to ledge. Those people, I believe, don&#39;t practice it because it&#39;s boring.\u0003The point of the video was to focus on methods I still viewed as practical, so something that\u2019s very difficult would probably not be a good fit for this video.<br><br>Can always do a part 2 though!\u0003@Alek Vuksinic Yeah, I know how to do it hahaha. I think if I end up doing a part 2, it will focus more on the less practical ways\u0003Def looks like I need to do a part 2 but I wanted to focus on stuff that\u2019s still practical. I feel like laser turn around isn\u2019t imo\u0003Let me know who you&#39;d like to see on the next episode in the comments!\u0003Hey guys, just a heads up but Walt accidentally set my mic to 200% in discord so that&#39;s why I&#39;m louder/kind of distorted. Definitely unfortunate and I did my best to try to mitigate the volume differences but sorry in advance, and we&#39;ll make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again!\u0003Nah they\u2019re both legal\u0003I think if you\u2019re just starting out it does make sense to me to look into what controller you wanna use, as it\u2019s always going to be a pain to have to re-learn the game later on if you switch.<br><br>That being said, I don\u2019t think the GCC is inconsistent enough for me to tell new players not to use it or something. It\u2019s still a fine way to play and learn the game\u0003Good to know! Will keep this in mind, but def had audio issues with this particular episode due to the levels issue I pointed out. I\u2019ll make sure to check this in the future\u0003@burntfish44 don\u2019t wanna get too in depth on this but coordinating guests can be tricky and not everyone wants to be on a show discussing this stuff, or doesn\u2019t wanna be on with other guests etc! Something to consider <br><br>I think I chose not to discuss the medical side as much because it feels obvious I guess? As in, yeah we all agree having ergonomic playable controllers is super important, but how do we balance them?\u0003@Charles Braswell legit terrible advice LOL. Get this strongman bullshit outta here no doctor would ever recommend you \u201cfight through\u201d RSI\u2019s you take breaks and modify stuff among other types of treatments\u0003Hmm, we definitely mentioned both of these points. I know I specifically mentioned how it allows people to play with RSI\u2019s and other injuries repeatedly, and mentioned that making the switch is very difficult repeatedly so you may have just missed it(\u0003I\u2019m so confused LOL\u0003My advice: just start. Don\u2019t worry about qualifications, focus on making stuff, and focus on making stuff you know. If you don\u2019t know a lot about the finer details about the game, make content about stuff you do know (could be things about the players, you name it). The most important thing you can do is just to start. You\u2019ll never get better if you don\u2019t get experience under your belt! If you aren\u2019t good at putting stuff together in practice, the only way to close that gap is to do work and get better :)<br><br>As for whether I\u2019ve been PR\u2019d, no, but I\u2019m also just not an active player. I left my scene in 2017 to move to Vancouver, entered a handful of tourneys there and then got in a car accident and couldn\u2019t play for years. After that COVID happened and I have shifted more towards focusing on commentary and videos, vs competing. <br><br>FWIW I had some decent results before I left (top 64 at EGLX, top 96 at GOML). Not anything amazing but also decent lol??\u0003Was waiting for a comment on the collection! Lots more in the shelve behind the doors below and my fianc\u00e9 and I have even more upstairs \ud83d\ude2d\u0003Nope! I did study the humanities though so I wrote a lot of essays. I did a communication studies degree, with a minor in history.\u0003Yes!\u0003For some reason the webcams were glitching a bit this time, so sorry about that guys!\u0003Yeah we\u2019d usually have them but since we weren\u2019t keeping track of the specific topics in advance this time, it was harder to keep track of what each topic was. Moving forward, expect to see those\u0003Banning a technique is not the same as directly changing a characters frame data. Also by this logic you could also say banning the freeze glitch or pound stalling or peach bomber stalling is \u201cfiddling with characters\u201d but no one thinks those count lol?\u0003I feel like I directly address the &quot;it would divide the community&quot; argument in the video so I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re saying it would be a huge issue for the scene?<br><br>Literally all tourneys use modded wiis anyway, and all of them run UCF mods. Ignoring the other points I bring up in the video, how can you argue that UCF doesn&#39;t create a divide/barrier, but stages would?<br><br>Also, what makes Frozen stadium &quot;it&#39;s own beast&quot; in your eyes? If we ignore the technical reasons for it being on slippi, many players were asking for Frozen Pokemon Stadium for quite some time. If that&#39;s ok, why is adding stages not ok?\u0003Yeah I actually messed up the audio levels a bit I think, need to work on that in the future, hopefully it won\u2019t happen again!\u0003@T-Dot yeah I\u2019d like to figure this out for tonight\u2019s episode as well as it\u2019s super frustrating. Especially creating a thumbnail with stuff like this lol....\u0003@Ovadya Rachman I mean, like the comment I made explains, the others have good cameras as well but discord was glitching or something and walts the one hosting the stream so that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t have any issues with his camera.<br><br>To be fair though June\u2019s camera does suck lol\u0003What a nice comment! Thanks so much and glad to hear you enjoyed it! Hopefully our future episodes will be even better\u0003Your username lmaooo\u0003Like anything we add, you can make this argument. I think it\u2019s completely fair if you think Melee is good as is and doesn\u2019t need extra stages.<br><br>I think extra stages might be fun, likely wouldn\u2019t harm stuff too much, but also isn\u2019t necessary.<br><br>Main purpose of the video is to try to break down the arguments that I think are just bad/wrong. Hopefully I succeeded in that sense, but it\u2019s still fair if the root of your opinion is \u201cstage changes aren\u2019t that interesting to me and I\u2019m fine with melee as is\u201d\u0003@Sam the Bag Man For the record you seem like a totally reasonable nice person hahaha not trying to suggest that you don&#39;t care about the community or the game!<br><br>What I mean by the 2-3 jigglypuff characters is just 2-3 characters that the majority of the community dislikes playing against. My argument is basically &quot;if the idea is that buffing the low-tiers would make the game better, I&#39;m not convinced because it might just add in more characters that people dislike&quot;\u0003There\u2019s another perspective that I would add to this discussion that\u2019s relevant imo:<br><br>Here\u2019s a list of the low tiers in the game:<br>- Bowser<br>- Kirby<br>- Roy<br>- Pichu<br>- MewTwo<br>- Link<br>- Young Link<br>-Dk (honestly playable in some ways)<br>- Ness <br>- Mario <br>- Game and Watch<br><br>Some of these characters already have similar play styles to existing top tiers (subjective but still worth mentioning imo)<br><br>1) Roy is different from Marth, but it\u2019s not like the experience is so different that it\u2019s worth risking adding Roy. I\u2019m not positive I agree with this perspective but I do think buffing Roy wouldn\u2019t add as much diversity to the game as buffing mewtwo etc<br><br>2) Kirby is like puff without rest and bair lol. I don\u2019t feel like we need two Jigglypuffs. <br><br>3) Pichu is bad pikachu. This one is really easy lol.<br><br>4) Ness is kinda similar to other characters like Falcon, Mario bros...but with double jump cancels. Would need more of a redesign to  offer something new imo (like PM Lucas)<br><br>5) young link and link are very similar, so buffing them wouldn\u2019t diversify the experience as much as buffing two other characters would. <br><br>6) Mario is just bad doctor Mario in most ways. From a diversity perspective, they feel like YL/Link and Pichu/Pikachu situation. Doc is already viable so I don\u2019t think he needs changing. <br><br>So that leaves MewTwo, G&amp;W, Bowser, Link or YL, Ness with a huge overhaul, etc to offer a new experience. Which is 5 characters rather than 13<br><br>EDIT: whoops, I missed Zelda. She\u2019s totally different so that\u2019s 6 characters then!\u0003@Tucking Fypo I don\u2019t personally think this is a good example of the fallacy fallacy but I\u2019m not gonna argue that.<br><br>Your opinion is valid, but I do think it\u2019s still pretty clearly based an arbitrary definition of what makes melee \u201cmelee\u201d in your eyes (which is also fine since you\u2019re acknowledging it\u2019s just your opinion!). <br><br>Since we have done a lot to change the game so far, and are continuing to see changes...it\u2019s not really about being a purist so much as it is about you liking the existing changes to the game and disliking future changes right?\u0003Much of your entire argument gets shut down by acknowledging it\u2019s a slippery slope fallacy though? What if stage changes don\u2019t lead to any future changes to the characters? What would you think then?\u0003It exists already and it\u2019s called the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium fire and rock transformations lol\u0003@Eduardo Flores honestly dude I don\u2019t really have time to argue here lol. There\u2019s a lot of things I disagree with but you\u2019ll just have to wait for my video I guess. Cant really be expected to write mini essays in the comment section right\u0003This is something I will make a video about at some point but to share one a couple quick points:<br>-balance is just as important as making a game fun. Melee is very fun right now, and buffing these characters may encourage really boring play styles.<br><br>-every character being balanced is literally impossible in a complex game like melee, there will always be good and bad characters. Even if we somehow made it balanced, one player would push a character further and that would suddenly make that character the best, making characters that do well vs that character better and characters that do poorly worse overall, so this should never be your goal as it\u2019s legit impossible. <br><br>- not everyone believes that having to learn way more match ups is a good thing for melee<br><br>- a lot of these characters would likely have very campy/slow play styles or already have comparable characters that exist (Marth vs Roy). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth risking the existing state of melee (going strong for 20 years) to add in characters that might ruin everything essentially <br><br>You probably disagree, but melee is already quite balanced at the top. Several characters are viable and those characters have very different play styles. Marth, Fox, Falco, Puff, Peach, Sheik, Falcon, ICs, Samus, Pikachu, Yoshi, Doc, Luigi are all in the top 100 proving you can play and win with them at a high level. So your 1/3 number is objectively wrong. <br><br>Once again, we don\u2019t need to mess with that balance, half the characters are viable. <br><br>Melees meta is still developing, some characters may have more potential that we realize.\u0003You don\u2019t have to download roms, the game is the same? It\u2019s just a gecko code. The difference is quite large.<br><br>I feel like many other competitive esports have similar stuff and are still successful<br><br>As for legitimacy, if their rom is different the online mode won\u2019t function properly, so you don\u2019t need to worry about checking for that. In terms of in person events, we were already using modded Wii\u2019s anyway lol\u0003Yeah I agree the music was too loud this time, my bad!\u0003I made it lol\u0003Will definitely make a video on this at some time!\u0003@Asbj\u00f8rn Birkelund Not really? You just copy the mods from someone else who has them. It&#39;s literally as simple as copying the data on a memory card. <br><br>It&#39;s true that it is a bit trickier on your own but still possible, just requires more steps/equipment.\u0003I guess I figured more people knew this already but<br>1) most tourneys use Wii\u2019s + ISOs nowadays, for a variety of reasons (newer console, etc)<br>2) you can actually already load custom stages to an original GameCube with memory card mods so it\u2019s completely possible\u0003Wanna start by saying &quot;no, I don&#39;t want custom stages&quot; is a completely valid position! I also think the competitive integrity argument is subjective, but that&#39;s kind of the point. So while I would argue a well balanced stage shouldn&#39;t affect the competitive integrity too much, you&#39;re allowed to think otherwise! Despite all that, I do think there&#39;s some noteworthy issues with your arguments:<br><br>1) You can say you don&#39;t like the community influencing the game, but what you can&#39;t say is that adding stages would &quot;introduce&quot; community influence, when we already have community influence on the game. We have UCF, we have wobbling bans, we have a variety of stages we no longer play on, we have frozen stadium,  we have controller mods and notches, we have B0XX controllers, we have texture mods, polling fixes, online play...the list goes on.  So it&#39;s pretty clear that custom stages aren&#39;t going to INTRODUCE influence, rather they are one ADDITIONAL influence among many. <br><br>2) Then it becomes about whether or not adding stages is comparable to rebalancing the game in more direct ways, and this is where I&#39;d call what you&#39;re describing a slippery slope fallacy. Put simply, rebalancing characters isn&#39;t remotely comparable to adding/removing stages. The impact stages have is nowhere near as impactful as adding in l-cancelled aerials for G&amp;W, and I don&#39;t even agree that most people believe the G&amp;W change would be a good addition.<br><br>The big difference between stages and characters that I wish I touched on is this: we have no experience with changing characters because we&#39;ve never done it. Outside of NTSC/PAL (and random silly mods) our community just has no way of actually knowing what it would be like if we added a few frames to a move or not, and because of this the only people that I see arguing for changes to characters are (no offense to them) newer/less experienced players. I legitimately have not seen a single top player or commentator say &quot;we should make <i>__</i> do more damage&quot; or whatever. Even changing Peaches turnips is not a position I&#39;ve heard someone legitimately say they want, just something that &quot;might be better&quot; but they personally don&#39;t want to change. <br><br>On the flip side, we actually have a lot of experience learning what makes a stage good vs bad. We&#39;ve played on several stages and know what kinds of effects they can have on a game. We know that walls are bad, hazards are bad, slanted ledges are bad. We understand the differences between no platforms, tri-platforms, two platforms etc. We understand how platform heights can affect things. We understand how ceiling changes affect things. Does that mean we could just blindly make a new stage with no testing? Of course not. But what it does mean is that as a community, we should be able to tell after testing it thoroughly whether or not a stage is worth playing on...because we&#39;ve been playing on stages for 20 years. If you watch any notable person react to the stages they pick up on a lot of stuff immediately because of this. They notice the cameras on the stages aren&#39;t that great. They notice that certain stages platforms are way too high and would lead to camping. And then after playing on stages more, they notice even more stuff. I believe you should give the community more credit (with stages, not rebalancing characters).<br><br>You say it&#39;s &quot;not always clear whether a stage is ban worthy or not&quot; and I agree, which is why I advocate for significant testing beforehand (something I explain in the video). Do you really think if we added Jungle Japes the balance of the game would just descend into chaos??? Do you really think that the tier list would just suddenly radically change? I find this pretty hard to believe. Sure if we just randomly added in all 12 stages it would be a fucking mess, but no one is advocating for that lol. I haven&#39;t really seen any players advocating for adding these stages without pretty major tweaks (except Jungle Japes). <br><br>As for whether or not it&#39;s bad that players can ban FD...I mean, the previous stage bans we made were a good thing so I don&#39;t think you can argue that it&#39;s a bad thing that people/top players have influence on the game??? While I&#39;m not sure I would want FD banned, this argument just doesn&#39;t really hold up for that reason. This should be a collective community decision I agree, not something driven by a single player, but it&#39;s generally been a good thing that top players have said &quot;yo rainbow cruise is wack&quot; etc. I really think this argument doesn&#39;t hold up under scrutiny at all?? <br><br><br>Once again, it&#39;s 100% valid to not want stages and to want to preserve melee as is. It&#39;s also reasonable to worry that even if the stage we were adding was battlefield, that some people may go &quot;he only one because of the custom stage.&quot; But people already say this kind of stuff about lots of factors so I&#39;m not sure what makes stages special. Off the top of my head, people argue that: brackets were favoured, matchups were favoured, controller affected stuff, b0xx is too different, stadium transformation cost the set (think back to plup vs mango at summit) etc. People will always say this stuff, and while I agree that there&#39;s a difference between legitimate/illegitimate complaints, I still think it&#39;s worth brining this up.\u0003@Splozy Well I wasn&#39;t trying to show a face to one specific argument, more trying to use the intro to demonstrate this is a relevant topic within the scene that influential people care about if that makes sense\u0003\u200b@Splozy I mean, I agree twitter isn&#39;t a great place for discussion. That&#39;s why I made a YouTube video lol<br><br>Also, many of these were taken from threads, where people explain their positions more thoroughly, but posting huge threads on screen isn&#39;t as visually effective right. <br><br>If we did use forums, I wouldn&#39;t be screenshotting a page long essay right hahaha\u0003I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s Twitter, it&#39;s just that Twitter happens to be a better platform for discussion than other alternatives. If we all went back to forums, which admittedly were better in a lot of ways, this video&#39;s intro would just be me posting pictures of forum posts instead of tweets. I&#39;m hesitant to agree with the idea that without twitter, the discussion would be radically different?\u0003To be fair, a gamecube/wii is around $30 where I live at a lot of stores, so it&#39;s really only the Melee disc that&#39;s pricey. Even accounting for that, not sure where you got the $300 number?\u0003Might just be you? I feel like a lot of people see this topic as a pretty exciting way to inject some fresh content into melee??\u0003Hopefully it made some people laugh lol\u0003If you pay attention to the video, I directly address the &quot;Nintendo problem&quot; separately. In that section, I pretty much touch on every argument you make in this comment. I think it&#39;s pretty clear that the reason I&#39;m bringing those points up separately is that of course Nintendo is an issue, and it gives them a visible legit reason to go after us (although they already have that with frozen stadium), but it&#39;s important to address the other arguments (that you apparently don&#39;t care about). The previous arguments are brought up in the context of how it affects balance, etc. That should be clear. <br><br>Not sure why you believe UCF is radically different when it&#39;s still fundamentally arguing the game, and most importantly, not sure how people can argue Frozen Stadium is that different when it&#39;s literally just straight up removing the majority of a stage, and directly mods it. <br><br>You&#39;re kind of focusing solely on how Nintendo is the issue but there&#39;s more nuance to the argument and you&#39;re not really seeing how you&#39;re ignoring that nuance so I&#39;m not really sure there&#39;s going to be any productive discussion moving forward lol.\u0003Agreed! I think if there&#39;s one big change I&#39;d like to see across all of them is a pretty big overhaul on the cameras. I think some of them are tolerable but I still think there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement.\u0003Try <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/DietMelee\">https://www.patreon.com/DietMelee</a> <br><br>This is the patreon but the whole thing is free! It&#39;s a mod to the textures so Melee can be run on shittier computers!\u0003I totally get where you&#39;re coming from but I don&#39;t really buy into &quot;if you change one thing it sets a precedent to change other things&quot; especially when the changes aren&#39;t related. People said the same thing about UCF because it was literally &quot;changing the code in the game&quot; and we still haven&#39;t made any balance changes or anything years later, nor do we plan on doing so.<br><br>I think a more reasonable slippery slope is &quot;if we change the stage lists, that will likely lead to people removing stage hazards.&quot; This isn&#39;t a slippery slope because the changes are directly related to each other. <br><br>In contrast, changing the stage list is just not the same thing as changing a character.  They might seem similar because both are &quot;changing the game&quot; but only if you genuinely believe all changes to the game are comparable to one another and I&#39;m almost certain you don&#39;t. Did adding custom textures lead to rebalancing melee? Did frozen stadium lead to rebalancing melee? What about UCF? A reasonable person has to acknowledge that changing melee is not some universal category. There&#39;s a difference between each type of change.<br><br>If this helps, look at it this way...if we changed any of the stages, would it make game and watch viable? Or even noticeably better? The answer is pretty clearly no. However, if we change G&amp;W&#39;s frame data, that will have a MUCH bigger impact on his viability. That&#39;s literally cutting the lag of several aerials in half dude. This is why I brought up the fact that character&#39;s strengths are independent from stages. Stages may  weaken/enhance a characters strengths, but they don&#39;t magically turn S tier characters into B tiers or something, that&#39;s just not how the game works. <br><br>Stages are just not the same as characters, so even if it feels like crossing the stage boundary means crossing the character boundary, the reality is they are still soooo different.\u0003@NotJohnnyKim I get what you&#39;re saying but <br>1) FD is an incredibly polarizing stage so it&#39;s going to have the most effect of any change tbh. <br>2) The reason the changes would even be noticeable on the tier list is because of how close all the characters are in strength. So yes, it makes a difference but the difference is way way way smaller than changing frame data\u0003This is a very long comment so it&#39;s kinda hard to break it down quickly but some of my main thoughts are..<br><br>- First point: yeah I generally agree, I still think they&#39;re similar enough to justify comparing them<br><br>- Second paragraph: nah strengths/weaknesses of the characters are still independent of the stages. I already explain that stages can be used to affect balance so I&#39;m not sure exactly what the purpose of this argument is but there is a big difference between affecting a matchup/meta and actually making a character bad.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example:<br>Peach has really bad vertical mobility...so we if made a stage that had really high platforms that would make her matchups against other characters worse, but the problem is still that her vertical mobility as a character is bad, and these stages only highlight that issue. Does that make sense?<br><br><br>- Third paragraph:<br>You said it yourself, this is a slippery slope fallacy. We have had many other significant changes recently, and they don&#39;t necessarily lead to other significant changes (boxx, wobbling ban, frozen stadium, etc). Even if you argue this would be the biggest change (debatable) it&#39;s nowhere close to actually going in and changing a character&#39;s move data<br><br>However I think if we&#39;re being fair, the most realistic slippery slope is people seeking to change existing stages and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s totally unreasonable if it&#39;s removing stage hazards or bugs within stages. For the record, I do think you&#39;re just not used to battlefield ledges though lol,  i&#39;d recommend practicing horizontal recoveries haha as not using them will only hurt you in the long run<br><br>I agree we need to be careful and I really doubt we will see any changes to the characters ever, or in any time soon (maybe 10-20 years down the line if we make it there lol).\u0003Yes, both offline and online ideally but I recognize the Nintendo barriers here lol.\u00031)Just to be clear, you realize that the stages are not designed by Fizzi and can/have been used offline as well right? <br><br>2) Yup, if you don&#39;t want them that&#39;s justified and valid. I just really hate when people act like their opinions are objective/factual. <br><br>3) I mean, you can say this about any change...Boxx controllers will just lead people to leave, Wobbling ban, etc....and then you can just immediately make the counter argument that it may also bring in many  new people to the game (Boxx controllers could attract FGC players, wobbling may turn off potential new players..etc) <br><br>As for the floaties/spacies thing...well I guess that kinda just ignores the whole &quot;try to make a stage as neutral as possible&quot; argument that I made. I pretty clearly explain that if the stages are just buffs to spacies, that&#39;s a bad thing lol. I understand why you&#39;re nervous though, I&#39;m nervous too!<br><br>a) I acknowledge that they&#39;re fundamentally different but they are still similar enough to compare imo<br>b) Also to be clear, it&#39;s still possible to play these stages on a gamecube, just not without memory card mods (which are very very easy to add!)\u0003Reasonable comments got me pogging\u0003@Vorporal I mean the community already banned wobbling dude. the video isn\u2019t saying \u201cwe should ban wobbling\u201d that decision was already made???\u0003When did I ever say character balances lol. You can tell comments like these are from people who didn&#39;t even watch the video\u0003@Santiago Mackenzie I mean even this doesn&#39;t cover the fact that we have never added characters to the game lol. It&#39;s just a colossal leap that only seems to make sense if you don&#39;t actually stop and think about how different they really are\u0003Ahh yes, the Slippery Slope fallacy at work again lol. <br><br>The counter is &quot;Not only is designing new stages NOTHING like designing a new character, we have never made any changes to the actual characters in the game, whereas we HAVE repeatedly altered stages. They&#39;re really not comparable at all dude.\u0003besides the podcast which i&#39;m obviously gonna post thursday/friday\u0003It&#39;s coming!! will be the next video I make!!\u0003Most of them haven&#39;t been released yet unfortunately as I&#39;m still working on my second album. <br><br>The only one that has been released is &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; which you can find on my spotify.

It&#39;s called &quot;The Mixup&quot; and it will be live at 6:00pm EST on Walt&#39;s twitch channel (<a href=\"http://twitch.tv/turndownforwalt)\">twitch.tv/turndownforwalt)</a>  <br><br>We will be going over the topic of custom stages in Melee on a general level, and then break down each stage individually! It should be a fun time :)\u0003@Ross Baldwin That&#39;s so depressing lol, the algorithm is very frustrating. Unfortunately I&#39;m actually still recovering. Even though I&#39;ve returned to content, I wasn&#39;t doing it nearly as often as I&#39;d like due to injury. I still took time off work too, but hopefully I&#39;ll return prettysoon. I&#39;ve made a lot of progress in certain areas at least!\u0003Wait what hiatus?\u0003<a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/themixuppodcast/feed.xml\">https://feed.podbean.com/themixuppodcast/feed.xml</a> your wish has been granted\u0003To be honest some of this was intentional haha, at least on my end. I figured Toph is the most well-known person in the call, it makes sense to have him be the focus of the show. That being said, glad to hear you felt my perspective was valuable too hahaha\u0003Hahaha getting a couple comments like this, scar is one of my favourite people in the scene so definitely a compliment\u0003Literally awaiting approval from those platforms as we speak! Unfortunately for the first episode there\u2019s a bit of a wait for them to set up everything so I\u2019m not sure when everything will be online but it could take up to 5 days\u0003Back when i was clean shaven, people used to say I looked like Scar LOL. Not sure I see it anymore though\u0003That\u2019s our goal!\u0003<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freemelee\">#freemelee</a>\u0003I think it\u2019s easy to group a diverse group of people together, when in reality <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freemelee\">#freemelee</a> is being \u201chandled\u201d in a variety of ways.<br><br>Some are handling it by organizing new charity tournaments and fundraisers, others are handling it in different ways. <br><br>I respect your opinion all the same, but I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for a community to want to just do their own thing\u0003This might surprise you but Nintendo has a huge history of screwing over brawl and other smash games too. So fragmenting similar communities seems like a bad strategy lol\u0003We have multiple tourneys a year lol, that&#39;s how it&#39;s sustainable as an esport. If you have no tourneys, you have no earnings, and players can&#39;t support themselves. Think it through lol\u0003Our competitive scene is more than just Mango/Leffen/Hbox. If we lose all the people in the top 15-100 we lose a LOT.\u0003Lol...who do you think those top players are playing when they\u2019re streaming? Computers? They\u2019re playing other people...online....It\u2019s not just about losing tournaments, we could potentially lose Slippi itself. Which would leave the community with no way to play people. A game that\u2019s literally unplayable (as there\u2019s no alternative way to play) for an extended period of time (most likely a solid year, minimum 7 months) will lose an enourmous part of its audience.<br><br>Also, prior to rollback melee coming out, our community WAS struggling, and just look at how Smash Ultimate\u2019s competitive community has been doing ever since COVID happened. Bad online has seriously hurt the growth of their scene. That game is doing terribly compared to how it was.<br><br>If players are unable to actually play the game they like, yes it could actually kill the game. No streams/competition means most of the top players will not be able to keep pursuing this full time, which means we will lose the majority of our player base. No competitive tournaments means sponsors potentially dropping players, which means those players either have to try playing a different game...or get a regular job.<br><br>What about tournament organizers?  For the people who run events full-time, this means they\u2019re no longer able to do that either. Suddenly a huge part of the scene can\u2019t make a living anymore. Running an enouous tournament takes a huge amount of money up front (often 5 to 6 figures) and if Nintendo forces those tournaments to shut down, people just CANNOT take that kind of financial risk. <br><br>If you know anything about streaming, you\u2019d know that taking even a couple weeks off can make you lose a ton of subs...now imagine these guys taking a year off.<br><br>You clearly don\u2019t understand this stuff dude. If you talk to people who are actually experts in this industry, they understand just how serious this could be if Nintendo actually starts really pushing back on things.\u0003you could&#39;ve just ended the sentence at &quot;i&#39;m sorry I still don&#39;t get it&quot; hahaaha<br><br>you gotta play melee and watch some real matches to get an idea! Melee is not really close to any of the modern titles\u0003People make this argument a lot, but if it was just about money they would simply rerelease melee like they\u2019ve rereleased a bunch of their other old school titles.\u0003That&#39;s pretty weird because not understanding how the law works, seems to be an option for you lol\u0003@GD DatFatRat you\u2019re so close but you\u2019re not there yet lol. So Nintendo took the time to remaster the game, and sold it on switch. Yet they chose not to do this for melee even though the community has wanted Melee HD for years....<br><br>See the problem?\u0003My guy they literally just re-released Super Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine for the price of a full game. Where did you get the idea they want to focus on the newest of the new lol???<br><br>They legit charged full price for that game collection and made a huge deal about it!\u0003@304em did you watch the full video lol?\u0003there still is lol\u0003Wanna elaborate on which part of the argument I\u2019m straw manning, instead of just claiming that I am lol?\u0003@Lupy I get what you\u2019re saying but if you really think melee is pulling people away from ultimate, instead of bringing people into smash...I dunno what to tell you lol.\u0003Then why did they shut down the ultimate tourney too lol?\u0003@Kenneth Mclachlan I see lol\u0003?\u0003&quot;supporting&quot; and &quot;not destroying&quot; are too very different things. The fact that you can&#39;t see that nuance says a lot about the kind of biases you&#39;re carrying with you right from the start lol. We&#39;re not asking Nintendo to parade our scene around and celebrate it (even though if there was a comparable official release of Melee with online play, everyone in our community would be supporting it) we&#39;re just asking for them to not go around shutting down our events. <br><br>Also, no actually...you&#39;re not legally obligated to enforce copyright stuff, it&#39;s trademarks that you are obligated to enforce (or you lose the trademark). Look it up. <br><br>Nintendo can choose to allow fans to do things like make fan versions of games (i.e. rom hacks) or simply play a game online that never had online before, and that doesn&#39;t have to be an issue. It&#39;s completely up to Nintendo, as it&#39;s their IP. <br><br>If you want proof of this, just look at how companies like Sega, Capcom, and more have handled fan games, music, etc. Or just look at the fact that online play in Melee has existed for more than 5 years, and it&#39;s only when our community started hosting online tournaments (with an improved version of online play that was released back in June) because of COVID that we heard anything from Nintendo.<br><br>Strongly recommend that you make sure you actually understand what you&#39;re saying before criticizing people. Basing your opinions of off assumptions is stupid.\u0003@UndertakerU2ber you\u2019re fundamentally wrong about the broadcasting rights thing, and you\u2019re also ignoring the fact that any lawyer on YouTube is going to add \u201cthis is not legal advice\u201d as they\u2019re basically forced to do that.<br><br>You\u2019re right that he was 100% clear on the details, but we have a long and clear precedent that broadcasting rights are entirely in control of the company who created it. <br><br>I already outlined why committing to fighting a lawsuit is a huge undertaking and isn\u2019t worth it due to the broadcast rights thing but you\u2019re still acting like you know this shit when you don\u2019t. <br><br>The broadcast rights thing has been a long-standing issue across all esports dude, it doesn\u2019t take long to look it up\u0003I mean, give them some credit that after 15 years of Nintendo screwing them, they\u2019ve actually looked into their rights...<br><br>The problem, like in a lot of legal cases, isn\u2019t only whether or not  the law is on your side, it\u2019s \u201cdo you have the financial resources to fight this and is taking that risk worth it?\u201d <br><br>Fighting the cease and desist commits them to a legal battle that will take literal years to finish, and you might invest years into a battle that you ultimately end up losing. In the meantime, you wouldn\u2019t be able to continuing broadcasting stuff anyway.<br><br>We already know that Nintendo has the right to refuse broadcast rights, this has been explained repeatedly by lawyers, so Nintendo could still stop the tourney from streaming, even if their Slippi reasoning is proved to be illegal. <br><br>Also, for someone criticizing people for not looking into the issue, it\u2019s kinda funny that you didn\u2019t bother to watch the video I linked where an actual lawyer explains the law?\u0003For someone advocating for seeing both sides of the story, all you\u2019ve demonstrated is a very poor understanding of the situation as a whole.<br><br>Of course you can say UCF and Slippi are \u201cmods\u201d but do you actually know what those mods do? Because all mods aren\u2019t created equal.<br><br>You realize that the modification for Slippi is literally online play right lol? It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve rebalanced the characters and shit, they\u2019ve just added online.<br><br>Even UCF is a very basic mod that only changes a property in the game that makes some controllers better than others. It\u2019s literally just fixing a very basic problem that has to do with an issue with GameCube controllers....<br><br>Whenever someone says stuff like \u201cthey run modded versions of the game\u201d it\u2019s an immediate tell that they\u2019re arguing in bad faith. Literally all we\u2019ve changed is the ability to play each other from far away, the balance is the same lol fuck<br><br><br>Also if you think Fizzi has been working on Slippi Online for 20 years I really don\u2019t know what to tell you. <br><br>You could also just as easily argue that Ultimate had a team of developers and funding from a Triple AAA game studio to develop their online, and Fizzi did it entirely on his own with his own money.<br><br>But again, as I\u2019ve established, you\u2019re not interested in arguing about the reality of the situation because you\u2019re too lazy to learn about the facts. You just want to paint the community as crazy people lol\u0003People like Mang0, Armada, Leffen...these guys make most of their money from content creation. Some of it melee related, some of it not. But imo that\u2019s not making money from Nintendo....it\u2019s making money off your personality, your videos...etc\u0003So the reason why you feel this way partially has a lot to do with a fundamental understanding of \u201cmaking a living\u201d off the game.<br><br>How much do you think smash players make from tourneys? Was your guess close to the reality, which is that first prize at The Big House 9, one of the biggest tourneys in the scene, was $3636 dollars. <br><br>The overwhelming majority of top smash players are not, in fact, making a living off the game. And the ones that are, aren\u2019t doing it from tournament prize money.<br><br>So why should we be grateful again??\u0003I guess for me I see it sorta like this: <br><br>I hate what Nintendo has done to us, but I love the stuff Nintendo makes. Nintendo makes some of my favourite games ever and (imo) continues to produce great titles like BOTW. <br><br>If Nintendo just treated us fairly, I&#39;d love them fully, but they don&#39;t and it&#39;s super frustrating.\u0003Give what money?? <br><br>If you stop tournaments, you basically kill the esports scene lol, so it\u2019s pretty obvious why we don\u2019t want that\u0003\u201cGive you melee\u201d??? Do you think the \u201cfree\u201d in \u201cfree melee\u201d means \u201ccosts $0\u201d LOL\u0003@GIPSY and who exactly do you think is screaming from the rooftops about emulation???\u0003Technically speaking we don\u2019t know what will be targeted. Also, no one is \u201cbragging about using emulators\u201d and it\u2019s incredibly disingenuous to pretend that\u2019s what announcing an online tournament is.<br><br>Tournament organizers just want to run the tournaments they always run. It\u2019s not their fault COVID is happening. <br><br>That being said, I find it unlikely Slippi itself will be targeted, and VERY unlikely small tournaments/locals will be targeted either.\u0003I use a dynamic microphone which are generally quieter, and an audio interface with an independent gain control. This can make it kind of hard to tell if the audio is loud or not. Since you could turn the gain up on the interface, making it louder, which would make you think it\u2019s a good volume, but the computer gain would still be low (which is the actual volume). <br><br>YouTube  pushes the audio levels up/down after uploading either way but I\u2019ll make sure to be more careful in the future!<br><br>I know when I make music there are plugins I can use that give me an objective loudness value, so I\u2019ll look into similar plugins for premiere pro\u0003Yeah, I thought it was more but I was also accounting for them selling in-game items right. Which valve could just choose not to offer, and they\u2019re technically selling their \u201cproperty\u201d and contributing it to the event.\u0003@ShadowOfNexxus Nintendo doesn\u2019t decide the law though? I really don\u2019t understand how you can think that what Nintendo says actually influences the law in any way?\u0003@ShadowOfNexxus because video games are a different medium? Lol. You gotta actually research this stuff before weighing in dude.<br><br>Nintendo doesn\u2019t get to decide the law. You seem to be suggesting that Nintendo can choose to legalize emulators or not, but they\u2019re a corporation, not the Supreme Court.<br><br>Whether Nintendo likes it or not, emulators legality is NOT decided by then at all\u0003For what it\u2019s worth, copyright is not something you have to protect in the US at least. This is explained in the video I link to.<br><br>Trademark on the other hand (registering a brand like Nintendo for example) is. So if I trademark the name \u201cMicro Melee\u201d and smash summit starts selling Micro Melee t-shirts, I have to force them to stop,  otherwise I could lose my trademark. <br><br>In contrast, if smash summit played my videos/music on their stream without permission...it\u2019s actually my choice if I want to get them to take it down. <br><br>This is why Nintendo doesn\u2019t do anything about most smash events. If they were actually compelled to take these things down, we\u2019d see it happen all the time, and also from other publishers. <br><br>We wouldn\u2019t have multiple online events slip by with no issues.\u0003Of course we all want that, but at this point...we understand it\u2019s not going to happen. Instead, a more realistic goal is \u201ccan you at least not shut down/stop every attempt at growth we make\u201d\u0003Commentary varies event to event. Some events have a very casual culture, and the commentary reflects that.<br><br>Others are more professional, more \u201cesports\u201d and you see a much more professional side of commentary as a result.<br><br>I think before making a blanket statement about what melee commentary is like, remember to first check which kind of event you\u2019re referring to because I can assure you there\u2019s more nuance than you\u2019re noticing.<br><br>Also, if you\u2019re speaking to melee commentary from 10 years ago...obviously it\u2019s changed since lol\u0003@erick yeah lol, that\u2019s why I find comments like this...not super helpful tbh\u0003@lamberth I have, unfortunately, tried most of these things with varied success but yeah I\u2019ll give it another go. I haven\u2019t done much EQ on my voice yet so I\u2019ll keep that in mind loving forward\u0003I do the best I can to deal with it, but I&#39;m also on a medication that makes my mouth dry so that&#39;s probably why. Hopefully I can find a good fix\u0003@Billy Zhao no worries!\u0003Yeah this is true, but isn\u2019t this infrastructure set up by Valve itself? I know with other esports they\u2019ll have fundraising stuff where players can buy in-game items and the money for that goes to the players/prize pool. My understanding was that this is similar but I could be wrong, and either way I probably did t describe it perfectly!<br><br>I only had about a day to make this video so I think it\u2019s a little lower quality than some of my usual stuff\u0003Even if Nintendo chooses not to rerelease melee, something that on its own doesn\u2019t make a lot fo sense as they rerelease other games all the time...it\u2019s also a 20-year-old game. They\u2019ve made a ton of money off it already, if money is their issue just rerelease it then!\u0003@Syntax! except the ISO\u2019s aren\u2019t even necessarily stolen? If you own a copy of the melee ISO you can rip it yourself, and the legality of that is also not clear. Even if that\u2019s not how you got it, if you own a melee disc, is it really that different? I literally own multiple copies of melee lol\u0003"]], ["Nemo Hic", [39, "Apparently there&#39;s only one game in the world that has to be played. Shut it down already.\u0003<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letmeleedie\">#letmeleedie</a> Move on to brawl. If you want smash to succeed, go to ultimate. Elitist players crying over a 20+ old game. Play for fun.\u0003@Themightycow You&#39;re right, age of a game doesn&#39;t matter. Chess is played with big money and Yada Yada Yada. Let me first say I&#39;m not trying to pick a fight. Just expressing my opinions. <br><br>Im basing my opinion on current e sports like leagues of legends, Dota, Capcom vs marvel, dragonball fighterz, rocket league. Those games are updated constantly, an ever growing meta for the game. Ultumate does that too. Melee, does not. Ultimate is also in this rare moment of smash history where its 2 years this December, we still have 3 characters that are not revealed. Ultimate has crossed 20 mill sales. Now I know that that doesn&#39;t necessarily take out melee as an optional format to tournament, but it certainly goes against what Nintendo has aligned their business model to. Instead, it takes away SOME of the hard work that Sakurai has put in along with their team.  <br><br>So no, melee doesn&#39;t need to go away, but it certainly is a detriment to Nintendo.\u0003@Bonnjust i mean, you can just say that, its part of your civil rights. I would just hope you at least provide reasons why someone is ignorant.\u0003Hahahaha. Hahaha ha. I&#39;m sure Nintendo heard your tears running down and are making melee re-release possible rn. Haha\u0003@Aidan Klobuchar Whats the difference between hating and loving a company. Both strong emotions to staple on a company. And I never said I loved a company, even though I do have great admiration for Nintendo. Also, if you really don&#39;t care about nintendo games, I don&#39;t know why you have such a fight in this in the first place. Sure you like smash, but come on, radarssbm has you up in arms in something you sound like you really don&#39;t care about. I just wonder if your attitude wasn&#39;t sway from a one sided video about who is at fault for why things have devolved to this. I&#39;m a fan too, but this was not a video that spread blame evenly.\u0003Haha, let me get this straight. So, Nintendo made you love their game so much, then stopped it. Now you hate them for it and you tell other people to hate them too. \ud83d\ude04 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\ude02  Bro, you&#39;re a jilted girlfriend.\u0003Melee is life apparently. I say end it, get on ultimate, meet new friends.\u0003Nintendo is not the villain here. They took no ones game away. I bought 3 different melee disks in my life and Nintendo  never came to my house and took it away. But, a group of esport aficionados tried to alter and give Nintendo games away, then offered money as a prize for people to be part of the whole ordeal. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nintendoinnocent\">#nintendoinnocent</a>\u0003See, just, you don&#39;t get it. This is why I support Nintendo taking tourneys down.\u0003@S Y ill only respond to your first because this melee thing is never going to get resolved. I happen to know that Sega does that, but that doesn&#39;t prove anything. They hired them, but so what? It shows perhaps that other companies are willing, but Nintendo doesn&#39;t. There are things Nintendo doesn&#39;t need to do to be successful. Main beef to that is there are people shining light on these practices, but doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it means anything special. <br><br>You might not remember this, but when Wii came out, there was this YouTuber who developed head tracing techniques for Nintendo. He got hired by xbox, which then came up with Kinect. Kinect was bundled to xbox 1, then fans got angry and xbox stop bundling kinect. So where is the overall positive that hiring someone by ways of fan input? Shouldn&#39;t a person be hired on the merits of their resume and not by their fan game. And its not like the fan game they make can&#39;t be showed off in a resume. The fan game just can&#39;t be showed off in the public.\u0003@Bonnjust The audacity that people online think they know better than Nintendo. The same Nintendo thats still relevant mostly because they didn&#39;t listen to fans. Even after Nintendo lost all their 3rd parties, even after ps2,ps3,ps4, xbox, 360, one,, but let&#39;s listen to them now. You don&#39;t tell Willy Wonka how to make his chocolate, and don&#39;t tell Nintendo how to run theres. <br><br>Simple answer to these fan games. Its called original IP. If these people are genuine about being fans, stop, Nintendo won&#39;t embrace you. If she don&#39;t love you, don&#39;t give her gifts. You should know this by now.<br><br>Also, its not fans jobs to tell companies what to do. Real fans are die hard. You a real fan, don&#39;t get inside the field. You are attempting to be part of the business, don&#39;t. Fan games should be an honor, not a detriment to the company. Imagine if I were a crazy fan of say Beyonce, but built her a statue of her naked. What then, that gonna be cool with her.\u0003@S Y okay, I&#39;m sorry. Ill calm. I just think your sympathy is misplaced. Let me ask you, do you think the people of the last 5 years who created fan games were aware of Nintendos stern policies against fan games? I&#39;m sure they were, thats my position. They&#39;re nintendo fans, of course they would be, if they were true fans. Especially if they were technically able to create those fan games. If not, they would be at fault for not knowing. Its an industry known fact. Yet, they still put it out there in detriment to Nintendo and themselves. And if it were a true FAN game, they wouldn&#39;t be so upset if it were taken down. But if they were to fight about it, complain about it, I would question their motives in saying it was a fan game overall. I know they don&#39;t make money off of it, but if it were a fan game, shouldn&#39;t it just be the fact that they created it and it exist. There are other things than financial rewards that is attained when fans make games. There is also the adulation you get from fans when you create a Nintendo rip off. I sometimes think fan made games are solely there  to boast their own egos. And that is at the expense of Nintendo because then they have to set precedence. If not, Nintendo loses that power. They lose that power, they lose some of the magic. Look at Mario 35. Do you think Nintendo hasnt thought of it? If the fan game before that 35 was still available, do you think then it would eat at Nintendo profits? I know its free for the online service, but it&#39;s an incentive to get their online service.\u0003I disliked. I do own stock at Nintendo tho, but not because of that. But because melee isn&#39;t hd.\u0003Sure. I mean, you should change your handle though since that&#39;s nintendo/game freak property. Because not changing it makes it seem like what you wrote really isn&#39;t true. Sorta disingenuous.\u0003Way to virtue signal and showcase the epitome of flash reaction. Go ahead and put those restrictions on yourself because you feel so strongly about a situation that has nothing to do with you. If you&#39;re giving up on gaming and this helps you personally in life to stop playing, well I really hope its the latter.\u0003@Ryweis when does that ever happen. Everyone in a smash tournament is there because they know about it. Who is going to randomly go in, see the screaming crowds, go &quot;wow, this is magic land and I should buy smash ultimate because thats what they&#39;re playing here at this melee tourny.&quot; Stop it ,let melee die.\u0003All about the Benjamin&#39;s. Don&#39;t we have enough media to keep us entertained. We have to have specifically have smash or else.\u0003You are uninformed then.\u0003Shitty practices maybe, but not company. Theres going to be a Nintendo land, bro.\u0003Its already dead. Its gone the way of Mohaa, unreal tournament, teamfortress.\u0003@Falconeous Cooper Thats what disgust you? Full grown adults not being able to play a videogame online? You must cry everytime you see a candy wrapper floating in the wind. Haha\u0003Why would you put that kind of restriction on yourself? You are the epitome of first world problems.\u0003There&#39;s 100% possibility that Nintendo stopped that tournament from taking place.\u0003Its called Smash 4 wii u or Ultimate.\u0003Actually, if they supported it, you would get what you want. But since they don&#39;t, you got reality. Something you don&#39;t understand.\u0003Im sorry, did Nintendo take away your legally purchased copy of melee away? If they did, then boo on them.\u0003Happy birthday Melee, rest in peace. You can&#39;t rip because people keep bringing you back to life and stitching you up to be some zombie creature. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letmeleerip\">#letmeleerip</a>\u0003@Crazy Boy finally, a rational person(despite your handle)\u0003Grow up, theres so much to boycott. Have you ever heard of Nike?\u0003Change your icon for starts. Makes your declaration seem disingenuous. Or are you virtue signalling?\u0003@Mr Mosquito who let in Trevor Noah and his funny jokes?\u0003@Mistake 119 thats fair. So the argument boils down to a wait and see. I just hope the ones that are making the most noise actually do something.\u0003@Mistake 119 well thats the point isnt it? No one really cares to start one.\u0003@Gregory Fuller From a content creator stand point, Nintendo is a wall. But as a fan, they&#39;re a real life willy Wonka factory. Casuals don&#39;t see their decisions as the veil that makes them so relevant. Taking down fan games means they take the ideas and put it official games. That&#39;s why I support them when they take it down. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23imprisonmelee\">#imprisonmelee</a>.\u0003@Nick Mario movie slated for 2022. <br><br>By political, I mean their games don&#39;t tell any narrative other than something that moves the story. They don&#39;t want any social issues in their games. Keep it strictly in the middle.  Add their distance away from hot topics, and their release windows are average 3 months apart; they&#39;re golden.\u0003@rakkatytam haha, now whose projecting. Say something about my leagues update continously. How melee is stuck in its old firmware and can&#39;t fix all the buggy nature. You basically repeated yourself. Counter my points don&#39;t just reiterate projecting.<br><br>Or better yet, don&#39;t say anything at all and let this die like melee.\u0003@Tabetic Bee0 cool see that east. As long as you admit it.\u0003@RadarSSBM  You go on and on about some grand fight like its necessary. Instead of getting up in arms to celebrate a 20 year old game, maybe celebrate the one thats here now. And I get it, its your channels livelihood, you are radarssbm. But I can&#39;t help but think maybe your missing out on the current beauty we have now. Not only is ultimate alive and thriving, its still growing, updating, new characters, tweaked game play from update to update. Sometimes you need to give up the fight so something else can flourish. Melee dying isn&#39;t as bad as you think it is. So the friends you&#39;ve made don&#39;t follow you to this new game, but the unexplored possibilities are there now for you. The melee community will always be there, playing the game they loved, but ultimate is now. Start a RadarssbU account if not already. Start fighting hard for that like you&#39;ve been all these years. Let go.\u0003"]], ["Naim Rancier", [19, "Now don\u2019t get me wrong Nintendo has Made  bad decisions it we cannot shit on Nintendo and call them horrible but we cannot praise them for this either they are out of touch and I feel that people call them scummy for that even though in Japan you could ask Nintendo fans over there and they would agree  so just an opening\u0003So you are saying that believing in god  and apologizing for any sins and not wanting to perish will make it so god will never fail you if you believe in him\u0003@RadarSSBM thanks for educating me on the whole modding fiasco now I know more\u0003Sorry it is getting discontinued after this month because Google is removing flash I hate Google more about taking it down since Nintendo did not touch smash flash or the sequel\u0003They are old Japanese men they are out of touch but they are not scum bags like some say nor saints like others they are out of touch\u0003Also I can see where you are coming from and I will not support either I will just move along without ever getting lacking neither hashtags\u0003I like what you said in the p.s area of the comment very true\u0003They really should be open to mods even though it might \u201churt\u201d them I love Nintendo but they are out of touch and I can see that\u0003@Nemo Hic true\u0003@Nemo Hic I agree\u0003I could see why they did it and why Nintendo should Not have done it it\u2019s like a little gray area\u0003@Sebastian Swan true\u0003Same I love Nintendo but this pandemic got us all crazy and it has gotten to Nintendo doing these things\u0003Are you like just commenting without watching the vid ?\u0003@Falconeous Cooper that\u2019s a bit weird why would it sicken you for a company to want their IP\u2019S used legally\u0003They don\u2019t hate you they hate propel illegally taking games instead of legally buying them for a few bucks and waiting for the virus to end so they could play up front\u0003Boycott really I would like to see you try and also grow up you can literally boycott more important things than a game company how about company\u2019s that are racist or homophobic  grow up\u0003@Aidan Klobuchar yeah and here is a fun fact Nintendo asked the distributor of the modes copy\u2019s how they got them and they just said legally so Nintendo got suspicious and shut it down\u0003Well actually I think Nintendo is not terraces it because it might not just be as profitable to them\u0003"]], ["TheYearIs20XX \u2022", [15, "@Global Warrior How did Melee have spamming?\u0003@Global Warrior Here\u2019s one of my favorite Melee sets: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/phsu7eQVKlM\">https://youtu.be/phsu7eQVKlM</a>\u0003@Global Warrior I\u2019ll link you two if you want.\u0003@Alex It\u2019s alright!
