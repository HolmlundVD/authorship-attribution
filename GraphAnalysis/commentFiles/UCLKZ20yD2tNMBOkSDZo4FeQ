I highly recommend anyone who are about to go to college to watch your videos They are so educational\u0003Great tips but you really make a lot of freshman excited about entering college with that clip \ud83e\udd23 What&#39;s the movie please? lol\u0003I think your tips are brilliant Shane! They are all practical and applicable for every teen watching this. And not watching this til the end would be another mistake teens would make.. lol\u0003Wow! the list is dominated by Asian countries. I have to agree cost of living there is cheap and it&#39;s totally the place to be when you want to retire and enjoy the rest of your life.\u00038 years??? Gee! Sounds like a looooooooot of work. It definitely will take a lot of passion and drive to get a phd on a certain subject.\u0003You have no idea just how much you made someone happy with your videos. The information you share are all very very useful.\u0003I clicked so fast when I saw no MATH! haha This is going to be very interesting.\u0003I spoke to someone who&#39;s been teaching more than 10 years. And yes, sadly he wants quit teaching.\u0003People who go for a Phd are on a different level of being &quot;Educated&quot; so I am expecting very refined, well mannered, and sophisticated comments here \ud83d\ude02\u0003I\u2019ve been looking for this Master&#39;s degree video a long time.

I literally searched for videos for about these health degrees  last month.\u0003"]], ["Shannon Washington", [11, "Depends what you want to do. That&#39;s the first question. Don&#39;t get a degree just cuz. Find an industry, a role you want to achieve, go to LinkedIn, and find what ppl at that position took to get there. Don&#39;t do extra work and potential extra debt for no reason\u0003@DRC 53 for example a JD from duke is not the same as a JD from southern university. A phD from a no name school is less than an MBA from a top program. If you want to move up a corporate ladder, get a degree, get some experience, and get a reputable MBA part-time or online without going crazy in debt\u0003@DRC 53 if you have a JD you should understand. Your school means more than your degree in both law and in business. A MBA for people leaving the Warton school of business is pushing 200k. The average phD in business administration is not touching that and are not going to be executives at companies. Seriously go look online. Most ivy MBAs are on board of directors and in comparison to PhDs in business administration they do no exist at the top  in the same manner.\u0003I told someone early. A DBA is not worth the time or effort. Try to get into a top MBA program. It&#39;s shorter schooling and will actually push you more than a PhD.\u0003Agreed. Lawyers make more than pharmacist, less school, and less debt. Plus pharmacy is a dying industry, just go to the reddit pages or do basic research. So idk. Plus I love how he put dentist specialist as an extension of DDS. It&#39;s dumb. It&#39;s not another phD lol. I&#39;m sorry but I have to be real. Shane is a nice guy and he trys be he has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. I hate to say this but it&#39;s sad that ppl advisors are so bad that ppl will listen to a anyone with a camera. Fyi.. I actually do career advising and someone showed me Shane&#39;s video and I told them to avoid it.\u0003Avoid pharmacy. It&#39;s a dying industry.\u0003Don&#39;t do it. Pharmacy is dying. The stats show pharmacy is losing jobs and the fact that pharmacy is easy to get into because they are so many Schools are leading to lower pay. Look into it. If you want to do it go for it but be careful\u0003Yeah it&#39;s dying\u0003Debt can me minimized by scholarships and school choice so I wouldn&#39;t allow debt to income scare me if you are smart about it\u0003I work in biotech. Look me up if your curious. It&#39;s a good industry. Ppl make anywhere from 60 - 500k. Most are in the 100-200k range. It&#39;s best to get a masters degrees in something science and get ready to learn alot on the job.\u0003Not really.  An MBA from a Top 10 school will go WAAYYYY further. A Harvard MBA is basically a guarantee you will be loaded but a DBA from a B school won&#39;t get you anywhere in corporate.\u0003"]], ["Chioma Ifezue", [10, "Every college is a scam\u0003@ReaperKing I looked through those companies and their requirements most of it is all about having experience in the industry. They didn\u2019t say anything about having a degree.  If you to do that fine, I don\u2019t know how stable those jobs are some of the jobs I saw were temporary jobs, but don\u2019t go to college for art.\u0003@ReaperKing those are places that hire art majors? You haven\u2019t told me business/companies that hire art majors.\u0003@ReaperKing there are no jobs for art majors. Tell me places that hire art majors? If you like the gaming industry just go do software engineering and you can try to get into the gaming industry creating software for video games. All the engineering specialties (chemical, biomedical, mechanical) are hard, but you have to study hard and work hard.\u0003Um.. the hard majors pay the most bc most people don\u2019t want to go through the rigorous schooling. Easy majors don\u2019t have high pay because they are over saturated and everyone wants to do easy major. If you want to get paid a lot you must study hard subjects and work hard.\u0003You can but it\u2019s competitive because a lot of people have bachelors in psychology, and the pay isn\u2019t very good.\u0003If you are going to go to college nowadays in this job market and economy, you must go for a field (i.e technology, engineering, healthcare) is in demand and makes money. There is no \u201cI\u2019ll just go to college as undecided and figure it out\u201d college is too expensive to being there as \u201cundecided\u201d, no plan, no clue on what your doing. These colleges love when people come as undecided or just don\u2019t know what they want to major in, it makes the college a lot of money. High school seniors that don\u2019t know what they want to do need to RELAX! College is not the end all be all. Graduate from high school, work a little bit and figure out what you want to do with your life. If what you want to do requires college, then you can go to college. These universities and colleges are not going anywhere they will always be there. I don\u2019t get this notion where people think you have to go to college straight out of high school. I\u2019ve heard of people changing their majors 3-6 times which is ridiculous. Why waste that kind of money and time when you have no idea what you want to do? People continue to make these college richer without even realizing it.\u0003@Jeff mcbobberson changing your major constantly can delay your graduation instead of 4 years you may be graduating in 5 or 6 years. Many people that graduate from college have to go back to school and get another degree, that will pay their bills. It\u2019s not about passion when you have to pay your rent and other bills. These colleges aren\u2019t doing students a favor. The fact they even offer useless majors like art, philosophy, drama, etc is beyond me, but it\u2019s a business so they have to profit off of ignorant and naive 17-18 years. If you work a little bit and take sometime to think about what you want to do in life after high school you will ahead of everyone else. You will start fresh with no debt.\u0003@Criss O definitely, psychology is over saturated so there are many people competing with others to get into masters and doctorate programs, and to get jobs as psychologists. I don\u2019t why people don\u2019t know that you can be a nurse, pa, np, or doctor and just specialize in psychiatry.\u0003@Blake Jonathan even if you become a psychologist you are not even making that much money. There are other careers that make way more money than psychologist but require less education like IT, and Computer Science.\u0003"]], ["willson g", [10, "Shane!
