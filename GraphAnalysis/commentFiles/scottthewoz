[["Elijah Tang-Spigelman", [255, "@Random1567 You know Mario Odyssey? I recall a boss where you take control of a chain chomp and smack it right into the large bunny. Or Bowser where you literally are boxing him. Or in Mario Galaxy where you hit the baby Piranha&#39;s tail to smack its head. Or that King octopus where you have to deflect obstacles he throws at you sometimes multiple times to hit him. Or even Bowser in Mario 64 where you grab his tail and spin him around to hit one of the bombs off the platform.Those are clever and fun bosses in the Mario series!\u0003Idk, I feel like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=33m08s\">33:08</a> said it bluntly. And Scott says at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=40m11s\">40:11</a>, there are better bosses in other Mario games than this! Honestly, I gotta side with him here!\u0003@Hanako is best girl Okay so initially it takes a little longer, but once end game is near and once he finally appears after post game, it&#39;s much faster!\u0003Weirdly long time? He would appear in a few minutes tops when I needed him. I 100% the entire game in around 4 hours!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=58m37s\">58:37</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=1h04m30s\">1:04:30</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=1h05m09s\">1:05:09</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=1h05m13s\">1:05:13</a>\u0003@TheBandicoot Well crap then ignore all the other amazing games that have come out like Arms, Splatoon 2, Mario vs Rabbids, Kirby Star Allies, Smash Bros ultimate , Yoshi&#39;s Crafted World, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Paper Mario the Origami King, Links Awakening Remake, Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3, Clubhouse Games, Super Mario Maker 2, Mario Tennis Aces, along with the acknowledged Mario Odyssey and New Horizons!<br><br>BOTW 2 and Pokemon Legends will be amazing! You&#39;re basing your assumptions off of early builds and no evidence! Breath of the Wild 2 especially will be just fine and I&#39;m super excited about it! Overhyped? Or maybe just excited about one of the best games of all time getting a sequel and the first game in years to actually attempt to innovate the Pokemon franchise!<br><br>I give a sh*t about Mario Party and WarioWare. I pre-ordered both of them and are game franchises that I grew up with. Super Mario Party sold over 15 million copies, 7th best selling Switch game of all time, so yeah I think a lot of people give a sh*t about these games.<br><br>Look at the best selling Switch games. 8 out of 10 of them are brand new Switch games!\u0003Maybe why Nintendo WAS focusing so hard on it! Metroid Dread, WarioWare, Mario Party, Breath of the Wild 2, Pokemon Legends Arceus, Diamond and Pearl Remakes, that&#39;s a lot of not Wii U ports!\u0003Short games get short sections in videos!\u0003He did commit, this video is an hour long!\u0003He didn&#39;t forget, he doesn&#39;t bleep that word out anymore! See his DS accessories video for proof\u0003This is only the character he plays, he doesn&#39;t actually act like this in real life. You should see his other channel to see that he&#39;s actually pretty calm and composed\u0003The points themselves are useless though\u0003I 100% completed the entire thing in 4 hours. I think 3 hours just to beat the game is actually very generous\u0003That was clearly not meant to be taken seriously. \ud83e\udd26\u0003The DS which is way smaller has a mic!\u0003It&#39;s actually in 1080p in docked mode and it comes with an entirely seperate experience which I think is a pretty big upgrade\u0003It&#39;s a short game so it gets a short part in the video!\u0003He doesn&#39;t hate it, he likes it!\u0003I loved every minute of it! Wish it was longer!\u0003Targeted for all ages!\u0003@Juice Hedgehog The process of getting to that complete save file for one thing takes much longer in Odyssey! Feels more complete and full which I think is great! No having to replay the entire game a second time as a different character, no having to put five characters on the top of a flagpole, just one large and giant experience! And like I said, my friend is replaying Mario Odyssey for the 5th time now, clearly there&#39;s an interest in that! And if I want to replay it, I can! People can speedrun through the story sequences of the game in an hour in a separate save file! Or I can go through many of the sequences or obstacle levels again in my current save file or have a rematch with any of the bosses!\u0003@Juice Hedgehog Can&#39;t deny it? Idk man, I think I can! The concept of picking up the game, gathering a few moons for a ten minute play session, and then turning the game off is a great thing this game has going for it!\u0003@Juice Hedgehog Odyssey&#39;s ending like... didn&#39;t bother me though. I thought it was cute and funny! Mario still wins in the end anyways!<br><br>Moons are more valuable than coins because the moons power the Odyssey! I mean then you have the story related moons and the triple moons which do give you that sense of accomplishment and a congratulations. The stars in those other games are important too, but it doesn&#39;t mean to me well done you can proceed to the next level. To me it means great, now go do the same level all over again only slightly different! It doesn&#39;t feel like an adventure to me, it feels like I&#39;m just going through simulations of something for one outcome. Because nothing&#39;s connected! It discourages exploration. In Odyssey, it feels like an actual adventure like my own playground to explore and find moons!\u0003I liked when online was free and I didn&#39;t have to pay for it!\u0003Well because they saved the gaming industry after the Video Game Crash of 1983. It&#39;s thanks to Nintendo we are still playing video games today!\u0003That&#39;s a bit of a weird thing to &quot;correct&quot;! Carrot cake, fruit cake, ice cream cake, they&#39;re all still cakes. Minecraft PC, Minecraft Xbox 360, Minecraft Ps Vita, it&#39;s all still Minecraft! So it technically is a port of Minecraft! It&#39;s not wrong to say it&#39;s a port of Minecraft because the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is...still Minecraft!\u0003Worse than the Virtual Boy???\u0003Different Scott!\u0003@Cecille Wolters Why can&#39;t it also be like a Wii U? Because Nintendo took a word test and matched &quot;WiiU&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; together! The Wii U gamepad was a controller with the console plugged into the TV. The Switch is the entire console with only a dock plugged into the TV, it would be impossible to play games on both screens this way!\u0003Well what do you have to do to play on the TV? Put the Switch in the dock! What happens when you don&#39;t put the Switch in the dock? You cant play on the TV!\u0003Yes he does! You should watch the last video! At 18 minutes and 9 seconds of that video to be exact\u0003Well if Persona 5 can run on PS3, I will refuse to believe that!\u0003@Geeky gamer  I own a PS4 and I can play the main series games! So you also have been making assumptions based on my YouTube comments. The reasons why you don&#39;t think Persona 5 will come to Switch and I refuted them; there&#39;s no contract, the Switch is more powerful than a PS3, so why still say &quot;Well it&#39;s just not coming!&quot; But to say you disagree that Persona 5 Strikers was on the wrong console and then say but it&#39;s okay that the main game is not on the console is not looking at both sides, it&#39;s just being your own worst enemy!<br><br>Don&#39;t we both want the same thing here? Both want Persona 5 to be on the Switch? It&#39;s a great game that more people should get to play! Yeah we both want the same thing, yet we&#39;re arguing about it!\u0003@Geeky gamer  I didn&#39;t recall that part when I commented again but you actually not being able to play the game at all makes this thing even funnier! Personally, if I&#39;m a fan of a series of video games, I&#39;d hope that I can play them! Not bootlick the company and pretend like everything they do is alright! Imagine loving a game that you never played!\u0003Scott and the tattoo business don&#39;t go well together, just like how Boogie and the PS2 don&#39;t go well together! Scott and talking about stupid Nintendo games go very well together, just like how Pokemon Snap and the Wii U would have gone well together!\u0003Couldn&#39;t use a Wii remote to play them though! Had to use a GameCube or Classic controller\u0003He did talk about it in his video titled <b>Viral Games</b>\u0003Himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2qIAb9RLc&amp;t=0m27s\">0:27</a>\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2qIAb9RLc&amp;t=0m27s\">0:27</a>\u0003<b>his last video was 60 fps</b>\u0003@PANZERFAUST90 They aren&#39;t pictures they&#39;re silhouettes! They&#39;re genderless!\u0003@PANZERFAUST90 Those are bathrooms, this is a 5 second joke in a video. I think you&#39;re looking too deep into this bro!\u0003That&#39;s up to you to decide! \ud83d\udc40\u0003I can&#39;t tell at all! This is actually a clever idea for a video!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2qIAb9RLc&amp;t=0m24s\">0:24</a>. Did you watch?????\u0003Does the volume button on your electronic device not work?\u0003@Petrie E3 and False Advertising are only Nintendo? Don&#39;t think so!\u0003<b>His last video</b>\u0003Reaching new heights because these are some amazing examples!\u0003Fits the white color scheme of his thumbnail!\u0003&quot;But I&#39;m gonna talk about Wii U more!&quot;\u0003What&#39;s a swatch?\u0003The PS3 was also extremely difficult to program for!\u0003@fluffy54605 Watch out! Kids are becoming smarter than you!\u0003@fluffy54605 I am chill! Just correcting your blatant errors!\u0003He&#39;s talking about the remake of the original Luigi&#39;s Mansion! Look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2qIAb9RLc&amp;t=9m01s\">9:01</a>! He&#39;s talking about that game!\u0003That&#39;s actually not true, and a simple Google search would tell you that\u0003Well I mean some DS games came to Wii U on the eShop!\u0003The Switch has games in 1080p!\u0003No way! This is actually a really clever concept for a video!\u0003@BABA KAZI Good thing it can easily be upgraded!\u0003@BABA KAZI Well look at your original comment. You said Xbox Series <b>X</b>\u0003In the fictional Scott the Woz universe? Yes. In real life? No.\u0003The power of editing!\u0003Well 32 GB and the use of physical games but I see your point!\u0003Hooray the latest sports game!!!<br><br><b>Sees that the latest NBA 2K21 is discounted 92% off on the Nintendo eShop</b><br><br>Quality over quantity!\u0003It is irrelevant...just like cloud gaming!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ZLFSeSz8E&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> you need to let him finish his point!\u0003Because he&#39;s funny and he makes high quality videos!\u0003How are you playing them for free? I have to pay a subscription fee for it!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ZLFSeSz8E&amp;t=6m33s\">6:33</a>!! That&#39;s right!\u0003@Maury J. In paper lol please no it isn&#39;t. You don&#39;t have a single source that proves that, you&#39;re just making crap up again! The Stream Deck 512 GB $650?? You can get a decent PC for that price! You can get a great Switch, a 1 TB SD card and tons of quality games for they price! The Outer Worlds has been patched since launch, it runs much better now. But you wouldn&#39;t know that because you don&#39;t actually do research yourself!\u0003@Maury J. It factually isn&#39;t 20 times more powerful you&#39;re making stuff up again! The Steam Deck also isn&#39;t outselling in preorders, there is literally no evidence for that! And yeah SD cards are cheap, I can get a great SD card and a Switch for a cheaper price than a 64 GB handheld that can only really play one game with that amount of storage! You haven&#39;t even played The Outer Worlds on Switch, it actually runs very well! You keep making facts up!\u0003@Maury J. Well the Switch isn&#39;t $399 it&#39;s much cheaper than that! There are still options to enjoy the Switch at half the price. And the Steam Deck isn&#39;t 20 times more power, it&#39;s about 2.5 times more power, ultimately not that meaningful when you get the cheapest model too because if you get the cheapest version, you&#39;re gonna need a bigger SD card and since PC games take up more storage, it&#39;s going to be a pretty hefty price! Or the most expensive version for $650? Well then it&#39;s a price thing again, you can just get a regular gaming PC for that price or even cheaper! Cheaper games? Which system is the one where I can get The Outer Worlds for $24? \ud83d\ude02 Oh yeah the Switch!<br><br>No saltiness whatsoever by the way! The only saltiness are the high seas on the ship you&#39;ve been sailing! The Steam Deck won&#39;t hold a candle to the sales of the Switch!\u0003@lemons We&#39;ll never know and we&#39;ll never have to know because frankly it doesn&#39;t matter. On his business card, he was a Corporate President, in his mind, he was a game developer, and his heart, he was a gamer \u2764\ufe0f<br><br>His influence on the industry was exponentially positive and his legacy will forever be known. We were so lucky to have him as Nintendo President\u0003@lemons But his successes far out weighed his shortcomings by a long shot! Everyone makes mistakes, but Iwata made a lot less mistakes than many other people in the gaming industry!\u0003@lemons A casual gamer is a gamer that plays games casually. A non gamer is someone who doesn&#39;t play games!\u0003Watch <b>Game Compilations Compilation -Scott The Woz</b><br><br>It&#39;s a call back to the end of that video! Or at the very least, a reused concept for a joke!\u0003And if you don&#39;t live near a data center or have a stable internet connection?\u0003@BlueSubaru A library doesn&#39;t advertise that you can read their novels with severe dyslexia, but that won&#39;t stop them from giving you books just as having slower internet won&#39;t stop companies from letting you use cloud services! Big difference being that libraries mind their own business while companies like Google are trying to make cloud services and streaming games the future of the industry!<br><br>You can say it&#39;s stupid but not everyone has good internet and not everyone wants to have their whole collection of games in the hands of a company that could take them away from you at any point! Or not everyone wants to be forced to use online servers to play single player games. I mean come on, this stuff isn&#39;t unreasonable!\u0003My internet like many others does not allow for the seamless benefits you get out of it, so I have to agree with Scott!\u0003Doesn&#39;t look like it!\u0003@Aaron  I&#39;m not talking about the collector&#39;s aspect, I&#39;m talking as the person who was selling the game! That dude who had a cartridge of a game that anyone can easily play online got $1.5 million for having the game physically. Something that will never happen with digital or cloud gaming!<br><br>You still can sell your games even with ones that need patches! Why? Because if you aren&#39;t able to download a patch from a disc, chances are that any digital storefront or support for that system are shut down entirely meaning the game isn&#39;t available digitally at all. Like the PS3 store eventually! I can wait 10 years and still be able to play a PS3 game if I have it physically, I couldn&#39;t do it digitally though without emulating! And that&#39;s where the ownership comes in!<br><br>Many people do play old games digitally and whatnot but that doesn&#39;t at all discount those who collect and still have the capabilities to play the games how they were truly intended! Collecting for retro systems is still a huge passion for people out there, because it&#39;s still possible and old physical media still works!\u0003@Aaron \u00a0Sony delayed it, but you&#39;re right it&#39;s still happening. So all of those Ps Vita and PS3 games are going away, but the physical games will still be there!<br><br>I mean the NES was around since 1983. Around 40 years! That&#39;s a long time! Cloud gaming hasn&#39;t been around for that long. Digital gaming was hardly a thing back then!<br><br>Consoles could fail first, but thankfully, we have retro dedicated consoles that play old physical games. Or even the latest game consoles which are backwards compatible!<br><br>Point is, you keep it physically, you have the game essentially forever! NES cartridges will outlive the PS Vita and PS3 store! Not bound to the rights to play the game by a company or by an internet connection, by doing it illegally, or with no capability of being able to sell the game back for money which is a whole other benefit of physical gaming. Someone bought a sealed copy of Super Mario 64 for $1.5 million dollars. Keeping the game for collection sake is one thing, but old games are also money makers!\u0003@Aaron I wish that were true always but unfortunately all of the games I bought on the DSiWare, they&#39;re gone forever now that I don&#39;t own one any longer. But I still have my cartridges! All of the PS Vita and PS3 games that were digital only would have been completely lost forever had Sony shut down the store. They will inevitably do it at some point regardless! I could get the ROMs online, but then I&#39;d be playing games illegally and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s dumb to not want to break the law!<br><br>And besides, this is a video on cloud streaming, and my point still stands. Physical games last longer than games reliant purely on streaming!\u0003He does say it though!\u0003@Alex Tuozzo Yes!\u0003Ignore the increased energy and electricity consumption involved with digital and cloud gaming...it&#39;s no better for the environment. In fact, it can actually be worse. Wired did an entire article on this too. They found that by 2030, there will be a 30% boost in gaming&#39;s carbon emissions if just 30% of players adopt to cloud gaming\u0003Nope!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ZLFSeSz8E&amp;t=2m20s\">2:20</a>\u0003Don&#39;t have to go to a separate menu to do that!\u0003I love his videos!\u0003He made on the Game Boy Color and Advance but not the ORIGINAL!\u0003Nostalgia is a heck of a drug! Obviously the Game Boy was king back then but today, the thing is outdated!\u0003@dawg Scott Cawthon made the games! Not Scott the Woz!\u0003Different Scott!\u0003You&#39;ll probably find it as some point! He made an entire video about how he&#39;s not an RPG Guy!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl4gKdI0J2o&amp;t=19m54s\">19:54</a>. Say what you want...that was kind of dumb!\u0003The Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance! But not the original Game Boy!\u0003He&#39;s just not an RPG guy!\u0003A History Teacher didn&#39;t have to be alive during World War 1 to be an expert on the subject!\u0003Here I know how you can fix that! Just hit the unpause button and enjoy this high quality video!\u0003@B. O. Nah he&#39;s got a lot of virgin energy!\u0003He&#39;ll just mellow out a bit, kind of like AVGN!\u0003They both make awesome videos! It&#39;s only a good thing for the viewers!\u0003Nah! I like it this way!\u0003\ud83e\udd21 \ud83e\udd21 \ud83e\udd21\u0003So is any official MicroSD card! I&#39;m using a non Nintendo 1 TB MicroSD from SanDisk right now!\u0003Because it&#39;s funny!\u0003@Cristian Duran  Which implies that you think JonTron would have kept the original basis of the joke! It&#39;s a great joke and I agree with Scott! I don&#39;t buy a Wii to play Dead Space Extraction, I&#39;d buy an Xbox 360 to play the actual games in the series. I mean I wouldn&#39;t buy a DS to play Dementium the Ward to be fair, but it actually feels like a game perfectly suited for the DS instead of a downgraded version or spin off of a better game on another console! Regardless of the video example, I think he explains the point well! I mean honestly, I know not everyone is into this kind of humor. But I&#39;m glad I like these videos though, because there are over 200 of them and they&#39;re a great way to pass time as many seem to agree given his popularity!\u0003Devolver Digital wasn&#39;t a part of E3. They were with Summer Game Fest\u0003Just Dance 2021 (last year&#39;s game) wasn&#39;t on the Wii either. So no, Just Dance DID NOT do anything new!\u0003Metroid 5 is the fifth mainline game in the 2D Metroid series. Metroid Prime 4 is the fourth mainline game in the 3D Metroid series. Metroid 4 came out 19 years ago, it&#39;s called Metroid Fusion.<br><br>Your comment is like saying <b>anyone else triggered Mario Party 9 is gonna be released BEFORE Mario Kart 8?</b>\u0003Woah you went to the future?? What&#39;s it like in 20013?<br><br>Oh and <b>1.1 million views</b>\u0003A utility clerk, A Universal Studios movie, A Ubisoft Original.\u0003They aren&#39;t random Nintendo games, you&#39;re just biased in liking Xbox more. And that&#39;s okay! It&#39;s an opinion, and Scott just has a different opinion than you!\u0003It got funnier!\u0003@Zain Mushtaq You must have done your inspecting with a foggy magnifying glass because that is completely false!\u0003No he didn&#39;t! Devolver Digital wasn&#39;t a part of E3, they were with Summer Game Fest!\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPv-mcEZyHc&amp;t=23m33s\">23:33</a> He isn&#39;t hating on this!\u0003Even more annoying than making funny puns of your name just in time?\u0003Looks good!\u0003Devolver wasn&#39;t doing their show with E3, they partnered with Summer Game Fest instead this year.\u0003That was just the opening! I&#39;m sure it gets better as the game progresses\u0003Elden Ring wasn&#39;t announced at E3. It was announced at Summer Game Fest which is a different show\u0003*Honesty\u0003It couldn&#39;t have been. Super Mario Party doesn&#39;t support handheld play. Mario Party Superstars does support handheld play. Imagine being a Switch Lite owner and being forced to buy a game that doesn&#39;t work on your system just to have access to buy a DLC that does support handheld play. Like forcing a vegan to buy an expensive plate of ribs just so they can buy a salad. Separate the games, and this isn&#39;t an issue.\u0003@Staringcorgi6 Well being a remake means it isn&#39;t a new numbered entry! Chronologically, the fourth game in the series is Metroid Fusion!\u0003It isn&#39;t Metroid Prime 5. It&#39;s just Metroid 5. Metroid 5 is the 5th game in the 2D Metroid series. Metroid Prime 4 would be the 4th game in the 3D Metroid series. Metroid 4 was Metroid Fusion which came out 19 years ago\u0003It was shown at Summer Game Fest which is a different show!\u0003<b>First new 2D Metroid game in 19 years</b><br><br>&quot;Forza 5 and Halo number 54 are more exciting!!&quot;\u0003@O Man Well length doesn&#39;t mean everything, or at least that&#39;s what I told my ex girlfriend.\u0003@O Man Now hold on man, you can&#39;t say &quot;fair&quot; to the first comment which asked where was all the gameplay but then flip the script and say there was plenty of gameplay when I talked about it despite the fact that you agreed with the first comment in regards to gameplay! There was very little gameplay and factually way less gameplay than Nintendo&#39;s showcase. You even agreed with Joel!\u0003Elden Ring wasn&#39;t announced at E3, it was announced at Summer Game Fest.<br><br>Summary: Your comment is the equivalence to &quot;American Football fan thinks the Chiefs had the best season. Ignores the Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Team.&quot;\u0003People are allowed to have opinions. Just because Forza was most anticipated game of the show doesn&#39;t mean it has to be loved and adored by everyone. The Last of Us 2 won Game of the Year, so now everyone has to love and adore the game! You aren&#39;t allowed to criticize it! \ud83e\udd26\u0003No\u0003Well then the video would be clickbait and I hate clickbait!\u0003@The void banana Why would I want to? You seem to be doing okay without one!\u0003And it works! Very entertaining and fun video!\u0003It&#39;s disappointing but also understandable. Technically Devolver Digital wasn&#39;t a part of the E3 show, they were streaming with Summer Game Fest this year! Everything else I agree with. Bandai Namco had so much potential to show great games and they don&#39;t and CGI trailers are not what players want to see!\u0003Oh well! Sega chose not to reveal this during E3, and this is the price they have to pay for this!\u0003That wasn&#39;t announced at E3! It was announced at Summer Game Fest which is a completely different show.\u0003Devolved Digital doesn&#39;t exist. But there is a studio called Devolver Digital and their show wasn&#39;t actually a part of E3, it was a part of Summer Game Fest\u0003Nearly 1 million views in less than a day and currently trending on YouTube. He clearly matters\u0003Now just think about the absurdity of your statement for a minute. Super Mario Party doesn&#39;t support handheld play, it doesn&#39;t support the Switch Lite. Mario Party Superstars does support the Switch Lite. As a Switch Lite owner, it wouldn&#39;t make much sense to have to be forced into buying a game that doesn&#39;t work on the system just to be able to have access to buying a DLC that would work on the system. That&#39;s like forcing a vegan to have to buy an expensive plate of ribs just to be able to purchase a salad. Separate the games and this isn&#39;t an issue!\u0003@Sgt.Nuclear Well at the end of the day, it isn&#39;t related to the subject and that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t talk about it! End of story!\u0003@Sgt.Nuclear But it&#39;s objectively not. It doesn&#39;t matter if people think it was a part of E3 (to which you horribly overestimate), this video is titled &quot;E3 2021&quot;, and factually, Elden Ring was not announced at E3 2021 it was announced at a different show. He can&#39;t be a casual for not talking about Elden Ring in a video on a topic not related to Elden Ring. If anything, it&#39;s a casual move to talk about Elden Ring in a video titled &quot;E3 2021&quot; since it was announced in a different show. He&#39;d just be plain wrong then. That&#39;s like saying to ESPN &quot;I can&#39;t believe you forgot about the Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Team which was one of the best teams in the Super Bowl this year!&quot;\u0003It wasn&#39;t announced at E3 casul! It was announced at Summer Game Fest which is run by a completely different organization!\u0003@Ezaron Just here to correct your grammatical error!\u0003*very good take\u0003Well that&#39;s GamePass! GamePass has the FNAF games\u0003Well that show is not E3. It&#39;s completely separate!\u0003Metroid Dread is the 5th mainline game in the 2D Metroid series. Metroid Prime 4 is the 4th mainline game in the 3D Metroid series. Metroid 4 in the 2D Metroid series is Metroid Fusion.\u0003Over half of those weren&#39;t even a part of E3, they were hosted and done separately from E3 like Devolver, PC gaming, Future Games, just to name a few!\u0003It did happen, at a completely different event called Summer Game Fest!\u0003You completely forgot that Elden Ring wasn&#39;t announced at E3, but at a completely different event\u0003PC Gaming Show wasn&#39;t hosted by E3, it was a separate event\u0003Devolver Digital was part of Summer Game Fest, not E3\u0003Ubisoft is pronounced like &quot;Utility&quot; or &quot;Universal&quot;. Where the &quot;U&quot; is pronounced &quot;you&quot;. Therefore, it&#39;s actually &quot;A Ubisoft title&quot; just like you&#39;d say &quot;We need to hire <b>a</b> utility clerk.&quot; Or &quot;That&#39;s <b>a</b> universally known fact.&quot;\u0003Maybe next time Devolver Digital will stream with E3 instead of Summer Game Fest next time!\u0003The person who doesn&#39;t capitalize the first word after a period, doesn&#39;t capitalize proper nouns, and doesn&#39;t even capitalize the first word of their first sentence does not have any right to declare what is and isn&#39;t grammatically correct.\u0003He&#39;s trending on YouTube so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a correct statement!\u0003Elden Ring was announced at Summer Games Fest, not E3!\u0003@M B Doesn&#39;t matter what got &quot;kicked off&quot;. Elden Ring was important, but it wasn&#39;t announced at E3, it was announced at a separate event by a completely different organization. In a video titled &quot;E3 2021&quot; it makes no sense to talk about games that weren&#39;t announced at E3 2021. I could go to a family member&#39;s baby shower, but you aren&#39;t going to see any pictures of that in the photo book for my friend&#39;s wedding next week! Unless you like clickbait, do you like clickbait? <br><br>Here&#39;s another equivalence to your comment. The Super Bowl kicked off (haha) March Madness! Therefore, when talking about the NCAA, I guess ESPN had nothing to say on the Kansas City Chiefs! \ud83e\udd26\u0003@M B You can disagree all you want but the video says E3 2021, not E3 2021/That One Game From Summer Games Fest. Summer Games Fest and E3 2021 are run by completely different organizations. That&#39;s like saying the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes are the same thing. Or that IGN and GameSpot are the same outlets. Or the World Series is the same as the Super Bowl. They aren&#39;t. They talk about the same things, but they&#39;re run by different organizations. Elden Ring wasn&#39;t announced at E3 so in a video titled &quot;E3 2021&quot;, he&#39;s not going to talk about games that weren&#39;t announced at E3 2021.<br><br>Your comment is the equivalence to this;<br><b>A week after the Super Bowl</b> <br>&quot;I guess ESPN had nothing to say about the Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Team.&quot;\u0003Elden Ring was announced at Summer Games Fest which is completely separate from E3!\u0003Devolver had their own show with Summer Games Fest which was not part of E3!\u0003Well Eldan Ring doesn&#39;t exist! He also didn&#39;t talk about Elden Ring because Elden Ring was announced at Summer Games Fest, not E3!\u0003They weren&#39;t a part of E3, they were a part of Summer Games Fest \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\u0003@ZuperNEZ Now hold on just a second! You can&#39;t say that this is the &quot;biggest news for Just Dance&quot; and pretend to act like you knew Just Dance had already stopped coming to the Wii. It really isn&#39;t &quot;big news&quot; if this had already been a thing for a year already. Unless of course, you didn&#39;t know about it. \ud83e\udd14 Additionally, the timestamp you put takes us to Scott saying &quot;There isn&#39;t anything new! There&#39;s never any real announcement here!&quot; Then your comment saying he missed the biggest news that it is no longer on the Wii implying that when you said it&#39;s no longer on the Wii, that you were oblivious to the fact that Just Dance 2021 wasn&#39;t on the Wii either and that you like others thought that Just Dance 2022 was the first time Just dance wasn&#39;t on the Wii. Then proceeding to try to cover up your mistake by saying it wasn&#39;t a mistake! Nice try, but I see right through it!\u0003You missed the news too then. Just Dance 2021 wasn&#39;t on the Wii either!\u0003Their show wasn&#39;t with E3 it was with Summer Games Fest\u0003That was announced at Summer Games Fest not E3!\u0003Elden Ring was announced at Summer Games Fest, not E3\u0003I probably shouldn&#39;t be telling you this...but Ubisoft actually had dropped Wii support last year...Just Dance 2021 wasn&#39;t on the Wii either...\u0003Devolver Digital was with Summer Games Fest, not E3\u0003How can they be the dark horse of E3 when their show wasn&#39;t even a part of E3? Their show was part of Summer Games Fest!\u0003Devolver Digital wasn&#39;t actually a part of E3, they were a part of Summer Games Fest\u0003Weren&#39;t at E3. Part of Summer Games Fest\u0003Devolver Digital was part of Summer Games Fest, not E3. But they did a great job!\u0003@Texelion 3D prints Yes Nintendo was a part of E3 and was hosted by them! Devolver Digital did overlap with E3, but their actual conference was hosted by Summer Games Fest!\u0003They weren&#39;t part of E3, they were part of Summer Games Fest\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPv-mcEZyHc&amp;t=15m06s\">15:06</a>\u0003They had their own show separate from E3\u0003@Finley Cooper Well then the title would have to be E3 2021/That One Game From Summer Games Fest 2021. And that isn&#39;t a very exciting title!\u0003Elden Ring wasn&#39;t announced at E3 but was announced at Summer Games Fest\u0003Well they weren&#39;t at E3. Their show was part of Summer Games Fest!\u0003Because their show was part of Summer Games Fest, not E3\u0003Their shows were not part of E3, they did their own things separate from them\u0003Maybe if they were a part of E3 and not Summer Games Fest\u0003They aren&#39;t part of E3! They were part of Summer Games Fest!\u0003@Hamad An update for amazing and fun games! So yeah, I think Nintendo won E3 because the games look like FUN!\u0003@Hamad Of course not, WarioWare, Mario Golf, SMT V, plus the games you mentioned above are amazing as well. Old games are classics, great that they&#39;re coming back!\u0003It&#39;s sad but Devolver Digital also was not actually a part of E3 so it&#39;s understandable!\u0003Hard to get excited about the <b>game</b> when they don&#39;t show the actual <b>game</b> ! Especially when that game is from a brand new IP we know nothing about. Like trying to get excited for a movie without actually showing something from the movie or a new song without actually playing the song! Unless of course, it&#39;s from a well established source such as the hype when Metroid Prime 4 showed up with nothing else to show, because the series is reputable. That&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s problem though, these are brand new IPs that we know nothing about! Hard to get excited for that when they don&#39;t actually show this game!<br><br>&quot;Here&#39;s my new movie coming out. It&#39;s called &quot;The Abyss&quot;. It&#39;s the first in a brand new unestablished trilogy. We don&#39;t have any trailer to show you. Get excited!&quot;<br><br>Or, &quot;I&#39;m a brand new recording artist who you know nothing about! My first single is called &quot;All That Love&quot;! I don&#39;t have any previews to showcase. Get excited!&quot;\u0003@Joker Smash is also the best selling franchise in the genre, Smash Ultimate is the best selling fighting game of all time,  and the series stands out because it isn&#39;t a traditional fighter! That&#39;s what makes inclusions like this so uninteresting honestly. Especially when you have some strong contenders like the character that goes by your name or Steve from flipping Minecraft! Steve or Crash getting added to a fighting game is something you&#39;d never expect. But Kazuya? That&#39;s all he&#39;s known for so it&#39;s really not that exciting!\u0003@Joker See that&#39;s what you think! But I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that Kazuya is not the most well received choice amongst the crowd here.  I&#39;d rather Keanu Reeves than Kazuya to be honest!\u0003$60 for an 11 year old Wii game that was $50 on the Wii and is $20 on the Wii U eShop, with quality of life features being only accessible with a $25 Amiibo. 60 fps. Okay, free emulators already do that. This should not be applauded, it&#39;s actually disgusting that they get away with this! Twilight Princess and Wind Waker HD were also $50 too and had more effort put into them.\u0003I think the implication was that Xbox didn&#39;t show much gameplay. Even games captured using in game engines didn&#39;t always show how the game was going to play!\u0003@kenny Stephens  Lol, you didn&#39;t like your most recent comment! I&#39;m glad you&#39;re letting the guy with &quot;2 brain cells&quot; boss you around! \ud83d\udc11 \ud83d\udc11 \ud83d\udc11\u0003@kenny Stephens Hey you forgot to like your own comment from earlier, just thought I&#39;d let you know! \ud83e\udd21 \ud83e\udd21 \ud83e\udd21\u0003@kenny Stephens You ignored my comments then so here&#39;s the TL;DR, Sony does it to well established franchises, Microsoft doesn&#39;t! That&#39;s why it&#39;s okay when Sony does it, not okay when Microsoft does it. Especially in this content where most of their reveals were CGI trailers! You listed a single example of Sony doing it from years ago, I can list at least five examples off the top of my head of Microsoft doing it in their conference alone! It&#39;s actually you that&#39;s being hypocritical saying that Sony fans have double standards, and then a few comments later saying Sony fans have zero standards! Double \u2260 Zero. Lol what a clown \ud83e\udd21\u0003Wasn&#39;t at E3! It was at Summer Games Fest!\u0003Elden Ring was at Summer Games Fest, not E3!\u0003&quot;Oh no, some angry trolls on the internet are mad that we delayed the game! Let&#39;s just release it broken and unfinished. That&#39;ll make them really happy!&quot;<br><br>Smh with that logic. The real reason is because of the marketing team at CDPR setting unreasonable deadlines to please investors.\u0003@lol head A very pessimistic mindset. Taking action and bringing awareness to the problem is much more preferable to accepting something that clearly isn&#39;t okay! Loot boxes in AAA games have become much less invasive and more fair now due to fans taking action and talking about it! If we didn&#39;t complain about it, it wouldn&#39;t have been fixed. We complained about it with our feedback and with our money, and publishers responded. This is no exception!\u0003False advertising is not okay!\u0003@Ignore. mE Hate this language because you can&#39;t even understand it. When I say the game is way better than your grammar, I&#39;m saying that the game is bad but I like it more than your grammar which is even worse. So I actually hate your grammar!\u0003@Ignore. mE Okay I take it back, the game is WAY better than your grammar! Can&#39;t even understand you. But truthfully, you should be blaming their marketing team for setting deadlines to please the investors. It has nothing to do with angry fans. You think angry fans influence AAA gaming studios?<br><br>&quot;The fans are mad that we&#39;ve delayed the game, so let&#39;s just release it broken and unfinished. That&#39;ll make them very happy!&quot; \ud83e\udd26<br><br> The only think you&#39;re right about is your username. I think EVERYONE should ignore you!\u0003Some angry fans on the internet don&#39;t influence AAA game studios.\u0003He&#39;s playing a character! This isn&#39;t how he really acts! You should check out his other channel if you want to see how he really acts\u0003Just not how we expected it...where did we get our expectations from? From CDPR and their trailers and press...so false advertising.\u0003&quot;Oh no, some angry trolls on the internet are getting angry that we delayed our game. So let&#39;s just release the game broken and unfinished, that&#39;ll make them really happy!&quot;<br><br>Smh with that logic.\u0003Because a AAA studio was so scared of some toxic trolls on the internet. &quot;Hey, these guys don&#39;t like that we keep delaying this game. So let&#39;s just release it broken and unfinished, that&#39;ll make them happy!&quot;<br><br>Smh with your logic. The real reason is because of the marketing team setting deadlines and forcing crunch time at CDPR to satisfy investors. Nothing to do with angry fans online.\u0003I wish my internet was that fast\u0003Whether you&#39;re Pro Physical or Pro Digital, we can all agree on one thing...Digital Only Physical games are stupid!\u0003Even then though! If you don&#39;t have a credit card, just use the cash to buy a digital gift card!\u0003Scott Pilgrim vs The World The Game\u0003You missed the whole point of the video! Digital games are fine! It&#39;s digital only physical games that are stupid and counter intuitive.\u0003@Dylan Combel Well if you also saw any of his videos, you&#39;d see he clearly has a large collection of digital games on his Nintendo Switch! Clearly he&#39;s willing to adapt to digital games. One of his most popular compilation of videos was him talking about digital WiiWare games! Even so, that doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t allowed to complain about it. Kind of like when I got my wisdom teeth got removed. I adapted and I understood why, but I&#39;ll still complain about how painful it was! Or kind of like the government. I love the government, but they aren&#39;t free of criticism!<br><br>I just think it&#39;s really funny how you respond with one word, and then write something else seven hours later. As if you spent all seven of those hours thinking of a response only to come up with a single sentence! \ud83d\ude02\u0003Did you watch the video? Digital games are great! Digital only physical games as in digital games being sold in physical game cases are stupid and counter intuitive. Look at the freaking thumbnail. They make physical box art and put in a download code instead of a cartridge, so it&#39;s actually no better for the environment than a physical game!\u0003You&#39;d still have to download the game through a download code...which requires internet...\u0003That&#39;s Scott Cawthon. Different Scott!\u0003@Specknacken The clear intention was her trying to ruin his career, which is more common than it needs to be. Point is is that there is no substantial evidence from her. Once the videos from Alex came out, she stopped talking about it entirely. It was clear malicious intent to screw him over by falsely accusing him of something he didn&#39;t do. It is something people do and it&#39;s really unfortunate you fuel it. I stand with people who provide evidence, it&#39;s innocent until proven guilty, not guilty until proven innocent.\u0003@Specknacken He uploaded 2 separate videos providing evidence and massive amounts of screenshots clearing his name.<br><br>He deleted the videos because he wanted to just separate himself from the drama. Totally understandable.<br><br>Both parties have just stopped talking about the incident entirely. Like, nobody is talking about it anymore. It has literally not been brought up now in over a year. Because it wasn&#39;t true and there is no actual evidence she has. Funny how once he released the videos, the people who made accusations against him stopped talking about it. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14<br><br>So you missed the video? Probably wasn&#39;t born yet when it happened I bet.<br><br>- At the Halloween party, Alex says they were both drunk <br>- Says she initiated and gave consent for everything <br>- They talked after the sex, and she says that she had trouble remembering the sex, Alex explained everything that happened<br>- devolved into an argument <br>- relationship was apparently toxic <br>- Felt that he was unheard in relationship<br>- Says that she was very jealous about everything <br>- Lots of double standards<br>- during the accusations last year he wanted to talk in person to sort it out <br>- Says accusations are a means to an end used as a threat<br>-taking legal action<br><br>You know I think rape is horrible. What&#39;s also horrible are false accusations. And this is a false accusation. It was consensual sex to which she initiated, not Alex. Aftermath, she didn&#39;t remember it but Alex did and tried to explain it. Leading to Alex being falsely accused of rape when it was actually HER who initiated the whole thing. Even funnier is you&#39;re practically the only person talking about this. Nobody even mentions it on RelaxAlex&#39;s own channel. Nothing was proven other than the fact that his ex was crazy and trying to purposefully ruin his career by making up false accusations. Thankfully, at the end of the day nobody will care what you say. Your comment will be buried to oblivion just like your other comments. What you say will not matter, because what you say is false. And what you say, over a controversy that has already been proven false and already passed is frankly what&#39;s actually pathetic here! Cancel culture can be good, but God, cancel the right people please!\u0003@Specknacken Well it&#39;s funny because it has all been proven false. His ex was confirmed to be crazy. So carry on.\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moj2wnzvQjY&amp;t=14m54s\">14:54</a>\u0003Sounds like a you problem\u0003$$$\u0003So he can make a video about it!\u0003@Pedro Sardini At the end of the day, companies just want your money!\u0003Not really, it&#39;s actually true! I buy a game digitally, but a physical version comes out and I kind of want to add it to my collection!\u0003@ItsFreakinJesus Clearly not because nobody else gives a flying hoot! Seriously, just RelaxMan!\u0003@ItsFreakinJesus I don&#39;t see anyone but you making a big deal out of something that isn&#39;t even a problem.\u0003Sounds like a you problem\u0003@Default Account GTA 5 is also on the Xbox 360 and PS3...\u0003You should check out his other channel then. You&#39;ll get to know him better there!\u0003That blue border has always been there! Look at any of his previous videos!\u0003<b>Always has been</b>\u0003@Gee Gog That doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was accused of rape\u0003The person who played the Supreme Leader was accused of rape\u0003I mean you don&#39;t technically own those games!\u0003RelaxAlax was accused of raping his ex. So Scott said bye bye and yeeted him out of the video!\u0003Super unpopular that is!!\u0003@Eeveeboi That does seem to be the most reasonable assumption!!\u0003There are multiple types of color blindness:<br><br>Deutan color blindness is a form of red-green color blindness characterized by the shifting of green light-sensitive cone cells closer to red-sensitive cells than is normal. This causes \u201cgreen-deficient\u201d color blindness.<br><br>Protan color blindness is a form of red-green color blindness characterized by the shifting of red light-sensitive cone cells closer to green-sensitive cells than is normal. This causes \u201cred-deficient\u201d color blindness.<br><br>Tritan color deficiency is most commonly acquired later in life due to aging of the eye or medical complications. It is characterized by a reduction in the sensitivity of the blue light-sensitive cones such that blue shades seem darker and less vibrant. In extremely rare cases tritanopia can be inherited also.<br><br>Achromatopsia is also known as \u201ccomplete color blindness\u201d and is the only type that fully lives up to the term \u201ccolor blind\u201d. <b>It is extremely rare</b> , however, those who have achromatopsia only see the world in shades of grey, black and white. In some cases low vision disorders such as progressive cone dystrophy can cause a gradual deterioration of color vision that eventually turns into complete achromatopsia.<br><br>Just because you&#39;re colorblind doesn&#39;t mean you only see black and white, there are multiple forms and types of color blindness!\u0003@Gianluca Sabatini For as long as I can still watch Kevin Spacey in House of Cards on Netflix, for as long as I can still watch Drake and Josh on Paramount Plus, I&#39;ll continue to be content with watching It&#39;s Awesome Baby on YouTube! I say that because this content was all made before we knew about how bad these people were. It&#39;s only a problem when it&#39;s actively known what they did and we CONTINUE to make content with them!\u0003@Seth Backup There&#39;s no actual evidence of such. It&#39;s more a he said she said. So at the end of the day, it&#39;s best to just stay out of it.\u0003@Dr. Gamecube I don&#39;t quite think that&#39;s valid as after RelaxAlax made his response video, Bobdunga stopped talking about it entirely! This all happened a while ago now at this point, no legal charges were made because she would need actual evidence if she&#39;d want to press charges!\u0003Glad he&#39;s in the video! His ex tried to ruin his career by making false accusations but it seems he was able to bounce back!\u0003Metal Jesus!\u0003There is no story behind it nor is there any proof of a story. It&#39;s just a load of spam that is completely untrue. The reason why it happens is because the internet can be a toxic place.

Panel De Pon came out for the Super Famicom in 1995, before N64 itself came out. The N64 was simply going to get a sequel to panel de pon which got cancelled\u0003@Juice Hedgehog Ocarina of Time was emulated while Panel de pon was a Super Famicom game.

Skyward Sword HD runs natively on Switch hardware as if it was a Switch game, so it is now possible to import BoTW areas to it.\u0003Having Splatoon 3 also being on Switch makes sense, because waiting 7 years for a new Splatoon game is too much because the playerbase can significantly die out after 5 years of nothing as everyone will get bored and result into empty lobbies.\u0003@linkthehero1234 he&#39;s a kid begging for attention\u0003but it runs at 30fps\u0003@Cube6 Gamer 3D All-Stars was just an Anniversary item.

It\u00b4s 2004-tech (or even older). We are living in 2021. So of course you can\u00b4t simply connect 4 DSes to it lmao...<br><br>The WiiU COULD handle 3DS-communication with 4 devices at once together with WiiU-players. Yet that feature was only used in &quot;Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate&quot;.<br><br>The Wii only allows communication of ONE DS dude. And only via INFRARED as far as i understood (Slow).<br><br>I find your thinking you simply can wirelessly use 4DSes on a Wii...pretty...amusing?<br><br>The Wii is utter shit. That\u00b4s why it sold.<br><br>Btw: Not even a Nintendo Switch can connect 4 switches at once. Since it stutters like crazy when you do run games then.\u0003a DS couldn\u00b4t handle Four Swords Adventures though...you needed at least a 3DS for it (266 Mhz processor).\u0003It seems Nintendo didn\u00b4t allow Minecraft WiiU to use the ressources Microsoft wanted too use on the WiiU.<br><br>Reason? It\u00b4s too dangerous. The WiiU in general is dangerous (in the wrong hands).<br><br>WiiU is perfect for AI, and big databanking and online (hacking).<br><br>Doesn\u00b4t matter. Now you can mod Minecraft very soon to get FULL touschsreeen-support (including drawing buildings).<br><br>But the new 3DS Version will allways lack chatting, onilne and modding support.\u0003WiiUs will soon be able to even emulate Steam dude...i\u00b4ts only a matter of time.<br><br>WiiU could even allow you to run 3 OSes at once. E.g. Linux on one core.A nd on the other you emulate Windows 10. And on the last core you do Mac OS.<br><br>It\u00b4s pretty clear that is this is possible.<br><br>No PC will be able to replicate what a WiiU does.\u0003@theGreenGoblin I reckon they simply didn\u00b4t want to make stereoskopic 3D exclusive to New 3DS models...that\u00b4s why they cut it from LM1.\u0003@theGreenGoblin Ok? But that was heavily downgraded (poor lighting, poor framerate, stuttering etc and even other stuff missing). See?<br><br>My point is &quot;Luigi`s Mansion 3DS&quot; is a port.<br><br>You also wouldn\u00b4t get &quot;stereoskopic 3D&quot; either since Luigis Mansion 3DS also didn\u00b4t have it (since 3DS can\u00b4t handle it, it stuttered at 30 fps or below).\u00033DS isn\u00b4t powerful enough for gamecube-games. That\u00b4s why.\u0003WiiU might be able to run Citra (3DS) next year dude...Just give it time. homebrew on WiiU is becoming 100x faster now.<br><br>Which means, soon enough Linux/Mac OS/Windows etc can run on WiiU. And then people can think over porting Citra over.\u0003@JmKrokY yeah. That\u00b4s what i meant.<br><br>For this reason i decided for the WiiU version instead. lol.<br><br>I also realized i never need to go out of the house because i got a new job.<br><br>So i don\u00b4t need handhelds any longer.\u0003That\u00b4s heavily downgraded dude. You pretty much wasted your money there since there\u00b4s not even online right? and no chat/mod-support etc...\u0003people cannot &quot;look back fondly on it&quot; years down the line. WiiUs will soon be SOLD out.<br><br>Game over.<br>I will simply buy all left over WiiUs there are...\u0003Youd\u00b4 get huge lag for Joyconns though...Just like Wiimotes got. Just like Skyward Sword HD on Switch has now button-lag.<br><br>No OTHER machine except WiiU can have the ability of PIXEL-perfect and accurate (gyro) motion-controls.<br><br>Not even a 5 Ghz PC can do it.\u0003Bad programmers too dude. They manipulated the WiiU\u00b4s OS by purpose.\u0003That would have costed like 199$. Nobody would have bought it.\u00033DS cannot run many N64-games dude!\u0003@K A then why no smilie?\u0003They can\u00b4t make another WiiU. IBM discontinued the partnership with Nintendo. And without IBM-chips you cannot replicate what a WiiU is.\u0003Why? Because he pretty much says that Nintendo Switch sucks?\u00033DS couldn\u00b4t handle it dude...you need a way faster machine to emulate a Virtual Boy!\u0003It\u00b4s a dead franchise by now...\u0003eh dude...The WiiU is faster than any PC. Sorry. But that\u00b4s just like it is. There\u00b4s a reason the exe-files are called &quot;REVOLLUTION eXecutables&quot;.<br><br>Remember? The codename of Wii should have been &quot;Revolution&quot;. But it wasn\u00b4t. The Wii was just the &quot;evolution&quot; of the Gamecube.<br><br>The real Revolution was the WiiU!<br><br>The WiiU`s processor can do stuff that no PC-/AMD/Intel-processor will ever be able to handle.<br><br>The WiiU can handle the world\u00b4s most complex OS. E.g .it was guessed Nintendo planned to implement ~1 Million Amiibos. Nintendo even had a face-scanning software ready for WiiU.<br><br>However people decided they didn\u00b4t like the gamepad and so Nintendo decided to ditch this software.<br><br>But it\u00b4s a working and finished face-scanning software.<br><br>The Playstation 4 and Xbox One aren\u00b4t even CLOSE to the WiiU\u00b4s hardware dude. They choose to go in the complete opposite direction...!\u0003@Eratoz you can\u00b4t replicate the precision of a touchsreen with a simple mouse dude. Get over it.<br>It takes much longer to create a level on a mouse (which takes you 1 minute on a WiiU touchscreen). You simply cannot do that in 1 minute on a PC.<br>You are talking about other games where they used a mouse to create low-precision stuff (such as Minecraft etc in typical PC lowend-games such as Minecraft or &quot;Garry`s Mod&quot;).<br><br>You cannot even replicate the CUSTOM Sound of Mario Maker on a PC dude. The PC cannot emulate that.<br><br>E.g. i also mean you cannot replicate the shaking-feature on a mouse. Since there is no such thing as &quot;shaking&quot; on a Mouse.<br>Which means you need to push another button (taking you more time since that\u00b4s stupid and slow since you have to find that button first).<br><br>PC`s uses outdated controls.<br><br>The WiiU has an interface which could (in theory, if you get to unlock it in the much too complex OS) let you use VR-goggles to produce Mario Maker levels. So this is a VR-OS. Which means there are ZERO buttons. This can be enabled via running custom RPL (drivers).<br><br>see?<br><br>E.g. if you would have a TRUE touchscreen-Minecraft on WiiU you would create Levels and worlds 1000x faster than on a &quot;PC&quot; in Minecraft. Fact. Nobody would take hours to do so...<br><br>You simply seem to lack understanding of how a touchscreen works and why it\u00b4s used instead of the older mouse-controles.<br><br>a Touchscreen isn\u00b4t about only &quot;Pushing buttons&quot; which are there displayed.<br><br>But actually DRAWING dude!<br><br>You draw what you want. And a Mouse cannot replicate the precision of a touchscreen. NEVER.<br><br>See? And this is why when i draw a house with a touchscreen it only takes like ~3 seconds to be COMPLETE.<br>But with a mouse the same task takes HOURS. Because you have to push every stone seperately there.<br><br>You cannot draw in Minecraft however.<br><br>But what if i told you: The WiiU allows runnig CUSTOM drivers now?<br>And this soon will enable us to make a drawing-feature in Minecraft on WiiU. Via modification.<br><br>Via running a CUSTOM RPL.<br><br>And when this happens the WiiU\u00b4s Minecraft will be way faster in creating worlds since you draw your worlds and not just use &quot;stones&quot;.<br><br>And to do this you need POWER my friend. Something a PC doesn\u00b4t have.<br><br>That\u00b4s why Windows 10 doesn\u00b4t support drawing in many applications (except in paint lol).<br><br>The WiiU is the first machine to be even capable to do this. And it\u00b4s quite easy to make this working, since the Touchscreen-interface is allready there. You just have to make a link into the game and make a custom driver and link it with the game.<br><br>Tldr: You are dumb. Since the WiiU uses a touchSCREEN not a touchpad!<br><br>And b) Touchscreen isn`t supported in Windows 7/8/10 for this reason: Not enough power.<br><br>Thus you cannot draw your house and move on. Thus you take HOURS to create house, after house after house.<br><br>And the WiiU uses a touchscreen with no visile latency. Thus you can immediately see what you build.\u0003You cannot do on a PC what you can on a WiiU though...The WiiU was planend to get a STADNARD-face-scanning software dude. =&gt; Much higher security than any &quot;PC&quot; will ever have. Btw: Touchscreens are much better input-devices when you want to build stuff.<br><br>Mouse is just 1980`s tech. Outdated. Slow. Bad for many clicks at once. Bad for complex stuff.<br><br>Mouses are good to control shooters. Or control units in RTS.<br><br>But building a level in Super Mario Maker takes you 10000 mouse-movements, not just 100 like in your average game.\u0003Iwata made the right steps...it was Nintendo (tm), the company itself which was against Satoru Iwata\u00b4s plans...!\u0003The WiiU is a dangerous machine...Nintendo knew that...\u0003I wouldn\u00b4t call this a &quot;console&quot; dude. The WiiU is not just a &quot;console&quot;. The WiiU is a combination of the console\u00b4s best features, with the PC\u00b4s best features. Without their weaknesses.<br><br>E.g. the WiiU\u00b4s processor seems to be build to allow the world\u00b4s most complex OS.<br><br>You can build a better OS than &quot;Windows&quot; on there. See? You can have all the functions you ever wanted.<br><br>E.g. you can build a 3d-glasses operated OS!\u0003The Switch has problems with running games with multiple Switches though...So how should that work? The 3DS was better for multiple 3DS than the Switch is for running games with multiple Switches...\u0003Satoru Iwata knew the WiiU should have never been created. There\u00b4s a reason they codenamed the exe-files &quot;Revolution eXecutables&quot;. The WiiU is dangerous...\u0003If it had sold 100 Millions humankind would get another problem then. I reckon. and that problm would be: Well i don\u00b4t know what happens when you have created an AI on a WiiU and then this AI begins to fight another AI on another WiiU...but i reckon the result would not be wished for!<br><br>And yes: The WiiU`s special processor is perfect to run an own custom AI dude. A REAL ai. Not a dumb-as-toast-AI.<br><br>The processor has specially designed to run powerful databanks and or an AI.\u0003No dude. The codename of the executables of WiiU is&quot;Revolution&quot;. And so the U stands for ultimate.<br><br>It\u00b4s the last microprocessor-driven box ever build if you ask me. The end of silicon-powered transistors.<br><br>The U stands for &quot;the processor which can run an AI which is as deadly as that seen in Terminator&quot;.<br><br>Your Avatar is very fitting here.<br><br>Remember. This processor was build for military, not for a consumer-device.\u0003It\u00b4s a military device. Nintnendo even planned a face-scanning software for this &quot;thing&quot;.<br><br>And if you ask me &quot;Thing&quot; is a good descrictipon of the &quot;WiiU&quot;.<br><br>The name &quot;WiiU&quot; alone was a mistake.\u0003Why should he mention those games when the WiiU`s processor was never intended to run such games and instead should run...you know: The big stuff.\u0003Actually WiiU can even run stereoskopic 3D dude (the same which 3DS does). That feature was just cut-away later...it\u00b4s still stuck in the OS somewhere though...\u0003@PKMN155 maybe they abandoned it since it had huge input-lag?<br><br>Since that\u00b4s a problem ALL modern hardware has (even Highend PCs have that problem and it\u00b4s getting bigger each year).<br><br>Except: The WiiU. It has a special designed processor which just laughs about &quot;Input lag&quot;.<br><br>The WiIU has ZERO inputlag.<br><br>You can see that when you create a game with &quot;Unity&quot;-engine where you use the microphone and a simple &quot;clapping&quot;-detection.<br><br>You will clap your hands and the character will jump over cliffs ok?<br><br>So it\u00b4s a simple jump n\u00b4Run.<br><br>The lag is not visible and you will notice, exactly when you have clapped your hands, the character will jump!<br><br>So the delay between clapping your hands and...jumping is just less than ~1ms. That\u00b4s 1/1000th of a second!<br><br>No PC and no other machine can do that.\u0003and you think that would work...well? Did you forget the HUGE input-lag the Wiimotes had on Wii? lol\u0003@Sir Jake It means exactly what i have written.<br><br>a) It\u00b4s a small, but dangerous box.<br>b) Nintendo planned a face-scanning-software for it (which doesn\u00b4t use pictures for the security)<br>c) it can make you 100% anonymous<br>d) it can kill. You can run a deadly AI on it. Put that in a &quot;terminator&quot;-like robot and it will kill. 100% aware of it\u00b4s environment. No mistakes. Just perfection. it has a 70 Tbyte/hour bandwith and if you run this bandwidth on a custom written AI it\u00b4s absolutely deadly.\u0003Nintendo should have never called it a &quot;console&quot; to begin with.<br><br>The &quot;Thing&quot; is much better fitting name. is a dangerous, little box. It can kill and it can make everybody that uses it 100% anonymous (As anonymous as somebody can be, by using any device wired with the internet).\u0003The game wasn\u00b4t optimized though...\u0003Did you forget that Nintendo themselves FAILED to develop stuff well for WiiU?<br><br>WiiU isn\u00b4t just a console buddy. It\u00b4s much more.\u0003@Alex 0! button presses in Skyward Sword HD have huge input lag. See press. They complain about it. Joyconns aren\u00b4t affected.\u0003that wouldn\u00b4t work as you\u00b4d get heavy lag for your input then...see like in Skyward Sword HD i heard it has that same issue for buttons.\u0003They should have called that machine simply &quot;revolution&quot; (the codename of it\u00b4s executive-files)...and that\u00b4s it.\u0003It\u00b4s funny you can play those on a WiiU-machine as well...\u0003you meant &quot;Personal Computer&quot; sucks? Since that\u00b4s 100% true.\u0003they shouldn`t have called it &quot;Vita&quot; to begin with...\u0003Nintendo even planned stereoskopic 3D for WiiU dude..\u0003Most likely beause 3DS cannot handle Virtual boy games?\u0003No dude. The OS was problematic. And the reason for that was that Nintendo themselves LOCKED the OS!\u0003The Switch-chip doesnt\u00b4have dedicated stereoskopic 3D-accelleration in the GPU unlike the 3DS!\u0003The WiiU machine (codename: Revolution) wasn\u00b4t made for Games only though..\u0003@bigjake360t did you forget the lag in Skyward Sword on Wii too? Lol<br><br>It was very noticable.<br><br>It has nothing to do with reflexes.<br><br>A lag means you CANNOT control your character like you want to. Or it controls different.<br><br>And thus you will die more often in the game because of this lag.<br>In Kid Icarus, where you have HARD enemies and not dumb-as-fuck enemies like in 99% of other games today, you will die immidiately if you make such a mistake of not moving fast enough because of delayed lag.\u0003No it wouldn\u00b4t. Wiimotes would have huge input lag...\u0003You need big screens though. Not tiny screens like on 3DS. The game is comlex. It\u00b4s a flight-simulator/platformer, hacker-and-shooter-game.\u0003The potential can still be used...But not everybody will be able to...\u0003The WiiU will be able to handle emulation of even PCs in the next years dude. Have you seen how much faster it has just become? speed imrovement ~100x!<br><br>This means: The WiiU can soon be used to replace a router too. Since it allows to download data with 50 Mbyte/second now (which would be the limit of USB 2.0 anyway lol) instead of 500 Kbytes/Second (which seems to be the limited of what NIntendo intended this machine to use).<br><br>Like i said: This machine is dangerous when you operate it with own software.. And when the day comes, that people find out the REAL reason this processor was created for...oh boy!<br><br>The hell is nothing against which bad stuff is starting then.\u0003@FrankStarr K I have a different understanding of &quot;decent&quot;. But of the online-games on Switch in general it runs &quot;OK&quot;.\u0003yes, but it also has no chatting and no good loading times. lol<br><br>And i heard online is also bad on it.\u0003Most people won\u00b4t be able to use the potential of the WiiU\u00b4s machine.\u0003WiiU! not Wii!<br><br>Wii is the console for babies and manchildren and grandmas...and WiiU is the master-machine which is codenamed &quot;revolution&quot; for a point. A good point.<br><br>WiiU is a hardcore-machine. Wii is the machine for casuals.\u0003@Reiki Rants you guarantee? Wow ok! Let me laugh!<br><br>Did you forget Switch SUCKS at online?<br>lol. This is more demanding than Mario Maker 2 online.<br><br>And you know how many online-games on Switch run like...They run like shit.<br><br>Mario Maker 2 gets how many fps online? I heard it hovers around 2-5 fps in online.<br><br>Switch isn\u00b4t even good online in games like &quot;Minecraft&quot;.<br><br>And that\u00b4s a blocky simple graphics game.<br><br>See?<br><br>Call of Duty is much more demanding than Minecraft though since you aren\u00b4t limited in such simple graphics and music is much better.<br>And yes:<br><br>The old Wii had WORSE framerates in ONLINE in Call of Duty compared to the WiiU. and much worse graphics of course.<br><br>And wanna know the joke?<br><br>Via patch soon and some homebrew-environment-tools (Aroma) we will UNLOCK the fps in all online-games on WiiU.<br><br>This allows us to run Minecraft at ~300 fps. ONLINE.<br>With 8 players speaking in chat.<br><br>However this is complex prorgramming. And not easy.<br><br>But the WiiU was made to run online games.<br><br>and the Switch seems to be made for singleplayer-only games.<br><br>See: And only when you can play other ONLINE games well enough you can maybe hope for any CoD to come to Switch...<br><br>But for now. The Switch simply seems to run out of juice.<br><br>That is because it\u00b4s tech is too old.<br><br>Btw: Not even PS5/Xbox one Series X can do what WiiU can do in online.<br><br>The WiiU is a complex beast. Never completely understood.<br><br>The WiiU\u00b4s processor is specialized on online-tasks. People are reporting the downloading is now up to 100x faster on WiiU as well via running custom homebrew via Aroma-plugin.<br><br>You also gotta remember. Many WiiU-Thirdparty-games which were ported to Switch didn\u00b4t feature online there. Games like Assasins Creed 3, 4 and even GTA would have all been online on WiiU.<br><br>I mean they planned a GTA 5 port or something like that. IT was never released. But WiiU got Watchdogs (with online) instead...<br><br>and even Splatoon 2 ran much worse in online on Switch than Splatoon 1. See?<br><br>And soon enough we will UNLOCK Splatoon 1`s online as well.\u0003Switch isn\u00b4t a console. And the DS-versions were...well. Completely different. Mainly because the DS used a drastically different GPU.\u0003The WiiU version is perfect. Well, for what you can expect. it has much better online than Switch and it has voice chat with 8 players. But yes: The price of it is that\u00b4s an outdated version.\u0003"]], ["Requiem", [59, "He wasn\u2019t lying when he said 14 pages :0\u0003Its 2:15 am whyyy but hiiii skimp\u0003Yeeeee\u0003@mr freakout ew daffy\u0003IGGY\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2qIAb9RLc&amp;t=6m50s\">6:50</a> did somebody say Requiem?\u0003No :(\u0003SKINNNTTTT\u0003What a strange analogy\u0003I\u2019m so happy he made this video as I just got into collecting for the gameboy! :D\u0003@Nightwolf85 cheers!

Breath of the wild is a cool open world, but it really doesn&#39;t do much different than other open worlds, its weapon system is annoying and while the act of exploring is really fun and one of the best ive had in an open world, the map feels empty and the combat is way too simple. really spiderman ps4 is better at doing what breath of the wild does best. <br>Smash is the same as it always has been, if you get melee running in an emulator you are not missing anything with ultimate, unless you want online support and competitiveness. <br>Luigis mansion 3 is cool but it gets super repetitive after a while.<br>honestly only for Mario odyssay i say its worth to get the switch, it has a massive library of really fucking great indies, but if you have a PC for that i don&#39;t see the point unless you want to play them on the go\u0003@Rosie Holstein they  made the hitboxes bigger so now certain jumps must be pixel perfect, and even when you think it shouldn&#39;t have killed you, it will kill you\u0003also them spyke and muncher hitboxes, what a way to turn something perfectly fine into an annoying shit nobody will want to do\u0003oh, you will be\u0003gta5 is available on xbox 360 the fact that they haven&#39;t put that one on switch is so dumb. the arkham games would be so good too\u0003yeah, anyone that says breath of the wild revolutinized open world games, clearly hasn&#39;t played any open world games besides breath of the wild, or probably think mario odyssay is open world.<br>what i usually hear about it is that the freedom that game gives you is unmatched, but im her like how? batman arkahm city, spiderman ps4, grand theft auto, all of this games have far more options and way of freedom than breath of the wild. but you can climb everything.<br>breath of the wild gets a lot right, i do think its a good game and some things it does are abslutely at its best here, but there is so many lacking on the game, what did it do to revolutionize open worlds? what did it do?\u0003no, emulate them.\u0003exactly, if people just bought the system for the games, systems like the wii u and gameecube wouldn&#39;t have been a failure. and the n64 despite having most of the revolutionary stuff, it sold mediocrely compared to play station\u0003its his humor, if you don&#39;t like it you are welcome to unsubscribe and leave.\u0003we don&#39;t want it to be released, but at this point the game should already be on the final stages so it is acceptable to expect a gameplay trailer.<br>the game is taking about the same time as BOTW1 took to develop from skyward sword. <br>we don&#39;t know if they will optimize anything and then they wouldn&#39;t have to rewrite the entire thing if it does, its already confirmed they will be recycling  the map, so they better bring a ton of new stuff into it.\u0003yet fire emblem characters still get in when they also are protagonists in one single game. 2 if they are lucky\u000325 bucks is still too much, that game should be like 5 bucks\u0003they have always been scummy, at least now you can use their soundtracks, stream their games, and they support some of their competitive games on tournaments, they really were terrible\u0003its been in develpment hell also, its only been 3 years since they say they restarted development. so that game is going to take another 2 or 3 years.\u0003how are this games action adventure when they mostly consist in turn based combat, that is the biggest lie nintendo has said\u0003i literally said  &quot;i take it that scott the woz doesn&#39;t play many open world games&quot;. that was so sudden and false\u0003yeah the mario maker 2 debacle is so dissapointing, i really thought people would go and buy that game but instead they bought the shitty new super mario game and that just sucks, not only that game probably killing the hype of MArio maker 2 but also people just buying nsmbu deluxe for 60 dollars with all the amazing 2d platformers that already exist in the eshop, there is rayman legends, yooka layle impossible layer, tropical freeze, ori and blind forest, hollow knight, Celeste, etc. and obviously mario maker 2. <br><br>Having such amazing options over 10 million idiots decided to pay 60 dollars for trash with nsmbu\u0003@RumoTu the game still has an adventure mode that has normal levels, and a normal endless mode where you can find excellent levels made by people that just aren\u2019t hard.\u0003you don&#39;t have to search 40 minutes, mario maker gives you some options, honestly just jumping into an endless expert is fun, part of the fun for me is just playing whatever level that randomly appears, and a lot of stuff is usually fun platforming, and expert runs don&#39;t bring impossibly hard kaizo levels or troll levels designed to kill you every second\u0003that helps the economy\u0003@Henrique &#39;MAL0KAA&#39; i still recommend to wait it out a bit, if you are lucky this version comes out and you can get a regular switch that could be cheaper.\u0003there is a strong rumor of a swithc revision that will be more powerfull, with it being 4 years old i suggest you wait if that thing actually comes out or gets announced\u0003nah dude, not even close, wii from 2009 up until wiiu 2015, now thats an era of peak mediocrity of nintendo. nintendo switch has had bad years but 2017 was fantastic, and 2019 was also really good. 2021 is shaping up to be the worse year tho\u0003they will, so hurry up\u0003hey hey hey, i complain about this, and i am usually firm with voting with my wallet\u0003breath of the wild revolutionized the open world genre?

Danganrompa 2 is 20 USD on Steam,  so 230 in total, or you could use it on Geforce Now pc version, so 10 USD for the subscription and 20 for the game. Is playing on the TV instead of on the pc version worth 200 USD?\u0003you still have to buy the game\u0003Brand new games are on xCloud day 1, and Geforce Now supports many new games, idk what you&#39;re talking about\u0003it still works well\u0003I use Geforce now becuase my pc is shitty, and using Geforce Now on pc with good wifi is almost as good as owning a good pc.

They put out that first Legends Arceus trailer despite the gameplay not looking great yet. They were honest. And then they improved it too.\u0003@cardfreak05 CP77 started full development in 2017. They were trying to make far too large of a game for a three year development time. Seriously, the game has three separate storylines to play through, and they had less time than they did with the Witcher 3, which started development in 2011, releasing 4 years later. They were making a bigger, more graphically demanding game, in LESS time. The fact that they were forced to rush development is the only reason it came out so bad, not because they were lazy or talentless.\u0003Well at least he seems to think the CP77 fiasco is due to the people marketing, not the devs. Too many people put the blame on them instead of the marketing that forced them to rush an intense game. <br><br>Also it shouldn\u2019t have released on 8th Gen\u2026\u0003I feel like Scott doesn\u2019t understand FF7R.

Robin, Corrin, and Byleth are all totally unique, and Ike is different enough by his side special alone. <br><br>Part of the issue is that Nintendo forces him to put specific FE characters in the game, and all the MCs use a fucking sword. If they put in Frederick instead of Chrom, it would\u2019ve been a whole new playstyle, but also wouldn\u2019t have represented the game as well.\u0003I mean not really, a lot of shit these days has required updates you won\u2019t be able to download if the digital versions are removed.\u0003I imagine why Fire Emblem 1 didn\u2019t have a cartridge was because it\u2019s, what, 10 kilobytes? Making cards for that is a little dumb.\u0003I feel games like Hades and Cadence of Hyrule were fair to have digital only for a while. The physical Cadence of Hyrule includes all DLC on the card itself, and the Hades physical copy has an art book and a soundtrack.... And only costs $35.

And then when I usually I do find pictures of the gameplay or go to YouTube to find somebody else playing it it looks like ass compared to the Fancy Nancy CGI trailer that I saw on the games page on Google Play.\u0003That&#39;s why I do the smart thing and emulate the s*** out of anything that&#39;s emulatable.\u0003I owned one in my teenage years and gave me headaches after playing it for awhile and yeah most of what I played would have been more welcomed on a normal console. In fact I don&#39;t think it had one killer app for it that makes someone outside of collectors think I need to get that. But to date it is still Nintendo&#39;s worst selling system.\u0003@Pizza Time I couldn&#39;t say much about Jack Bros cuz I only played it once.\u0003Especially with wario because a lot of people consider that wario game to be the best on the system.

So the fact that he may lose 80 bucks on destroying a Wii in a video doesn&#39;t really matter to him. Yeah I would like to have that kind of money too\u0003@cattysplat well yeah if the money required to buy video games was the equivalent to me as people spending a few bucks because I&#39;m so rich and yeah I would buy video games because what the hell else am I going to do with my money. But until that happens I&#39;m okay with emulation.\u0003@Baron of Z-Land yes I agree 100% with you like for example I emulate a lot of old NES games and to some people they may not be 100% perfect like they would be if I was running them on an actual NES but they&#39;re close enough for me that I can&#39;t tell the difference nor do I care. But like I said in another comment if I had the kind of money like Elon musk does and spending that kind of money on video games would be the equivalent of you going to the dollar store and spending a couple of dollars then sure why not but probably if I was making his kind of money I wouldn&#39;t have time for video games.\u0003@Akikaze I understand the hobby and follow a lot of people who are on YouTube who do collect. Cuz I love the retro video games. But the day I found out about emulators and ROMs it was like heaven opening up its gates and the angels singing me home. Because all I&#39;ve ever wanted is to play.\u0003Really that outsold the virtual boy? that&#39;s impressive!!\u0003@Henry Fleischer Yes for my experience with emulators everything after PS1 is kind of hit or miss whether they&#39;re good or not like for example the three PS2 games that I&#39;ve downloaded and played through an emulator on my computer two of them work perfectly those two being Shadow of the Colossus and ico the other one was NBA Street volume 3 was still fun to play just the announcer and the crowd were like on slow motion. The Dreamcast emulator I&#39;ve used in the past I think it&#39;s called recast or something like that. I can&#39;t remember now, but it ran most of the games I threw at it pretty well Sonic adventure had some music and sound issues but most of the other games ran as they would if I was playing them on an actual Dreamcast. I don&#39;t know about Xbox simulation cuz I haven&#39;t tried it yet. Some N64 games that I&#39;ve tried to play ran perfectly like for example conkers bad Fur Day ran better than it would on an N64 and look better than it would on an N64. But other games that I triedlike shadowgate I could not get shadowgate 64 to run well at all. So that is kind of a hit or miss emulator unless you really know how to use it. I guess there&#39;s ways to get them all to run pretty well but I don&#39;t know how.<br>    But PS1 emulators are great and pretty much anything before PS1 will work pretty well if not almost perfect. Like most of the 32-bit and 16 bit systems seem to have excellent emulators out there for them. As well as some of the newer handhelds like game boy advance and the Nintendo DS have pretty good emulators for them they run the games almost perfectly as well. As well as some of the older handhelds like the game gear and The game boy black and white color. Also the PSP has a decent emulator too and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because my machine is not the most powerful computer but it also has some issues with some of the games I&#39;ve tried to run on it being slow but again I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because of my computer or the emulator in general. I know what the N64 emulator it&#39;s because getting  N64 emulation right take some tweaking that I don&#39;t really know how to do with the emulators.  but with the PSP I don&#39;t know because all I&#39;ve ever run it on is the computer I have which is about the equivalent and power to an Xbox 360. So I hope that kind of helps you know what emulators are kind of good when emulators are kind of touchy kind of helps you in your quest to decide which emulators are going to work for you to try to play games on. Because I&#39;ve done a lot of emulation in my time and these are the ones that I have experience with other systems like the Jaguar have never tried emulating or the Saturn. The few times I&#39;ve tried to get neo Geo emulators to run I haven&#39;t had success but that&#39;s probably because of my lack of knowledge are some good neo Geo emulators out there but I just was not successful in getting them to work with the games that I downloaded. Also mame is a great emulator but it to take some tweaking for some of the games and takes a little bit of elbow grease to get working in knowledge beyond which I have to get all the games working on it like they should but apparently it will run a lot of the old school arcade games well if you know what you&#39;re doing. But it does take some study it is not as simple as like an NES emulator where you can download it show it where your NES games are on your hard drive and go play them it takes a bit more work than that.<br>      So yeah I hope that gives you a better idea and a fuel for what the emulation scene is like at the moment. I hope it was helpful no it&#39;s a bit of a long read but I was trying to give as much information as I could to try to help you to better enjoy your emulation gaming experience.\u0003@Henry Fleischer I would agree a lot of the systems after the PS1 are kind of Hit and Miss how they will run. But the Dreamcast emulator I used in most of the games I threw at it ran almost perfectly Sonic adventure had some issues the crazy taxi and a lot of the other games I threw at it didn&#39;t have a problem. GameCube some of the games would work okay but none of them were great. Haven&#39;t really tried the Xbox simulation yet to know how it would handle some of the old original Xbox games. But have tried the PS2 with some games and with Shadow of the Colossus it seemed to run it pretty well almost perfect and then when I downloaded NBA Street volume 3 and played and it played fine just the announcer in the crowd sounded like they were on slow motion.<br>     But most of the stuff from PS1 backwards all the way up to the original Atari 2600 the emulators for that stuff should run them pretty perfectly. Like turbo graphics 16 over the Sega Genesis or the Super Nintendo or the NES are the Sega Master system or the game gear or the game boy even the game boy advance emulators are pretty good. Heck there&#39;s even a Nintendo DS emulator on my phone that is perfect except for the fact that you&#39;re trying to play Nintendo DS games on the touch screen phone. But for the most part really old school gaming like the 16-bit era the 32 bit era and the 8-Bit era of gaming should not be a problem for emulation. Most of those should run perfectly or pretty darn close to it.\u0003@Mr. Eight-Three-One and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad video game it&#39;s definitely representative of the simple arcade games of that time I&#39;ve always enjoyed it when I played it.\u0003@Henry Fleischer you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice if you stopped at one emulator because you didn&#39;t like it. it&#39;s like eating pasta at one restaurant and saying pasta sucks because that restaurant didn&#39;t know how to make pasta. Because most of the old school emulators out there run the games about as perfectly as running them on the actual hardware. And with a gamepad and a couple of emulators it&#39;s kind of like having the system itself virtually. Don&#39;t let one bad emulator experience sour you against emulators because they&#39;re a great way to try games you may think about adding to your collection or a great way to play games if you don&#39;t want to pay some of the exorbitant prices for some of these old school video games.\u0003@Steel Bear yeah except every multiplayer game has a shelf life. There&#39;s no point in buying a multiplayer game unless it&#39;s just to play it for now because I guarantee you you come back 30 years from now to want to play the same game it&#39;s not going to be there anymore because the company is either gone or they&#39;ve moved on to other things. So you&#39;re basically paying for access to the game you never actually will own that game. I don&#39;t care how much you pay for it because at any time the company can decide to shut down the servers and then goes your access to the multiplayer game or it just doesn&#39;t pick up enough players so they have to shut it down because they aren&#39;t making enough money to keep it going. Either way you never owned that multiplayer game.\u0003Me either. that is why I don&#39;t get collectors. Because even if I had money lying around in my bank account for extra stuff I would not spend it on video games. And I love video games but I just don&#39;t get spending $500 to 1000 bucks on the game that I could get on the internet and play through an emulator for free. Because I&#39;m not interested in having bookshelves full of games and systems. I&#39;m only interested in playing the games and experiencing them.\u0003Who needs a great gaming PC when you can have a game for a system that was basically irrelevant because it sucked.\u0003Yeah but think of all the headaches and then needlessly ugly colored games you missed out on by not buying one.\u0003@Xored so was my comment.\u0003He was cleaning his house and he had a vacuum accident he mentioned it on Twitter\u0003Hey maybe that explains why my face is so disfigured and ugly and women avoid me is because I played the virtual boy so much as a teenager.

(3D world is just redonculously huge)\u0003Honestly, many of the complaints for Geforce Now.... is also present for PC gaming in general. Yes there&#39;s a crapload of initial setup especially when you also need to deal with PC hardware/firmware updates...\u0003Just a clarification: TECHNICALLY cloud gaming doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it has to be non-physical. Cloud gaming in it&#39;s essence means you use cloud resources to run the game. You could rent your own servers, install/copy your game into said servers, then use rented GPUs to stream the games to your thin client.<br><br>Disadvantage: requires good internet, has more latency, limited display capacity unless you know what you&#39;re doing since default GPUs don&#39;t stream to higher than average resolutions.<br>Advantage: practically unlimited scaling, is SUPERB for games that already requires online (as online games already has all the disadvantages that cloud gaming has, and actually likely runs them better). Especially notably, it&#39;s great for any online multiplayer game.\u0003Game subscription services basically is this, except you can borrow as many games as you want.\u0003@euducationator You mean 5G corona virus?\u0003@Big Chungus Meanwhile I spent $14 to play Psychonauts 2 (a roughly 20ish hour game) instead of paying $70. And I still have lots of spare time to play other games on top of that. Game subscriptions is admittedly better suited for shorter games with less replayability, so yes I rather buy hades while playing some other games while my stream subscription is still active.\u0003Yes, but that&#39;s a US issue. There&#39;re plenty of people with actually good internet services.\u0003You realise physical video games also uses single-used plastics in packaging, and often involves gasoline-powered vehicles to transport, right? :P\u0003Cloud gaming and downloading games are technically not mutually exclusive. Some game streaming services also lets you download the games, but gives you the option to cloud game on more platforms other than just the platform you downloaded on.\u0003@Piranha Plant On the other hand, Google might have the finances, but they aren&#39;t quite as good on persistence (google play music) and quality control (youtube). <br><br>If anything, I&#39;d trust Microsoft instead, because however much they suck at videogames, they have the financial power, AND the persistence, at least in regards to gaming. They practically brute-forced the XBox into a gaming mainstay, and they&#39;re still trying to get the whole Microsoft store thing to work. Heck, the current Game Pass is just an evolution of their XBox live services (hence why they&#39;re so intricately tied together in the ultimate pass)\u0003Then again, online gaming has all the inherent issues of game streaming regardless even if you&#39;re running said games on console.\u0003@Azrul Najmi Depends. Game Pass Ultimate has both streaming and and download options. GeForce Now lets you use your existing Steam/Epic library for streaming.\u0003While true, the issue isn&#39;t as bad as you think: All online multiplayer games has ALWAYS had this issue, and online multiplayer gaming is still very popular. (Even for online multiplayer games which processes your input locally, because eventually they&#39;d have to correct for latency from other players regardless)\u0003@Asterisk Security issues that are too inbuilt into the system to solve without a complete rework. At which point you might as well use the shockwave alternative.\u0003@lasarousi Depends. Some flash games became big enough to become standalone products outright, like Binding of Isaac and Alien Homonid.\u0003Isn&#39;t Doom technically famous for demakes, considering how everyone tries to get it to run on anything with a monitor screen and/or has access to one?\u0003Demakes are best when you give the job to people who are already good at making games in a specific style. The important thing, is that the demake must in itself be able to stand as it&#39;s own game outright.<br><br>Though thinking about it, the portable versions of some games could probably be considered a demake as well.\u0003Dark Void I assume is more famous for Dark Void Zero, like The Mummy is more famous for it&#39;s demake...\u0003Not really, considering it&#39;s one of the more famous &#39;demakes&#39; that outshone the original material, and IIRC is technically not even a demake since I believe it was built around the same time (And technically released earlier to begin with) so it should more accurately be considered a companion game...\u0003To be fair, 100 hours before you get bored IS great for a game.\u0003"]], ["RiskyWorks", [20, "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XYwd1TeH0&amp;t=58m05s\">58:05</a> A channel all about being funnny and making jokes constantly has one of the biggest points, yes nintendo online is kinda bad, I will admit they should fix it, but it works, we get a lot of classic games too (people complain about no virtual console because virtual conole had more games, when the vortual console literally forced you to pay for them indivitually, the amount of games on snes/nes systems on switch likely add up to the price it costs, and it is very cheap compared to ps+ and uhhh\u2026 The switch doesnt have 100/250/500 cards in denmark unlike playstation\u2026 Why doesnt it follow the normal 150/250/500\u2026 Idk) Switch online is an easy fix, third party is the key, when third parties make a game with their own server, it is up to them to make it work (And if you are minecraft dungeons, then dont try apparently, considering mcd crashes, freezes and lags, they promoted crossplay like it worked, does it work?

Scott the Woz started in 2017. The title is just more so a reference to the other video he already made, subtitled &quot;A Critical Second Look&quot; where he really played the game thoroughly for the first time since launch.\u0003It isn&#39;t even a wall, well, not *really*. He hasn&#39;t actually painted his wall blue (unlike the wall at his parent&#39;s house which was in the first videos of the show), you can rip off the blue part of the wall. You can say it&#39;s portable, if you will. It really comes in handy with consistency and whatnot, I think he considers moving from his apartment for something bigger for a bit of time now. When he does, the show can potentially go on flawlessly with exactly the same wall.\u0003@GPlumbob The fact that Tetris was from Soviet Russia was actually the main thing they marketed.<br>It was known as &quot;The sensation from Russia&quot; or something along the lines, and the &quot;exotic&quot; nature was part of the success. All this Russian imagery like St. Basil&#39;s cathedral, the Kremlin (or also soviet spacecraft) and of course the music were all deliberately added in to early Tetris ports such as the Game Boy version and not for no reason.<br>Also, Tetris was made in the late soviet era, corresponding largely with Gorbachev&#39;s term as general secretary, under whom Cold War tensions were cooling down substantially and relations between East and West were generally friendly leading to the end of the Cold War.\u0003A bit unfortunate, but I think Joe&#39;s not all to familiar with him or his (and most of the featured YouTubers) style of content. It would&#39;ve honestly been a bit weird to see him or/and Dave in this video, they could really be Scott&#39;s fathers after all. I&#39;d say their audiences don&#39;t overlap too much, although I personally enjoy both Game Sack and Scott a lot.\u0003I&#39;m pretty sure he wasn&#39;t really, at least not since he started. Like he said in the song, it was probably just a trademark at first, copy protection, so others couldn&#39;t just steal footage of his videos, especially when he wasn&#39;t on screen. Over the years as he kept including the blue border, he did plan to make this video eventually though. (Rather unrelated, but this remark at the end how the border got smaller at some time, is probably true. He might have shrunk it either because fans or himself finding it annoying or taking up too much space or just because he established himself and didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; a big border anymore. Perhaps Scott got the Idea for this video at that time.)<br>I think it&#39;s similar to Dick Vitale&#39;s It&#39;s Awesome Baby College Hoops, he initially thought it would just be funny for a devoted Nintendo fan to display such an obscure Sega Genesis game with that rather ridiculous name in every episode. Eventually he would decide on making a fully fledged special episode. Scott also used Breakout/Block Destruction from 3D Dot Game Heroes because he liked the track and the game. I mean it&#39;s a great homage to Zelda and pretty underrated, dare I say. I&#39;m almost certain he will make a (special) episode about 3D Dot Game Heroes some time, like pointed our by several comments, but I doubt he has planned too far ahead.<br>It&#39;s nice to imagine he has been building this up for years though.\u0003@Truxej He has, but perfectly filling four entire walls with games and get them to stay that way (even just so he could capture it) isn&#39;t as easy to pull off and takes a lot of time.\u0003The news ticker mentions how a new iMac was announced which wouldn&#39;t crash anymore and let to video creators nearly losing months of work, which leads me to suspect this may have happened for this video...\u0003Might be some sort of dummy cartridge, I don&#39;t think the cover would pull off that easily, but then again it has been some time.\u0003@D movie I think so, it&#39;s definitely the most obvious choice. I can&#39;t think of another game or concept which is featured in pretty much all of Scott&#39;s videos unless I miss something.\u0003I think it&#39;s a bit in between. At first, the border was more for (stylistic) purpose than a plot point much later, but he probably thought about doing a video like this for potentially years. He knew he would make the 200th episode special and probably include some sort of Madden 09 vs. Madden 08 or something, feature his friends and many colleagues for longer, but as he made more and more episodes he had more to incorporate in this one (The other specials, like the Dark Age of Nintendo series especially). The result is pretty much a perfect amalgamation of all ScottTheWoz, I would say.\u0003And it was done by none other than Insaneintherainmusic! :D\u0003Seriously, if a true Scott connoisseur (and also fan of a lot of other things gaming and what not) would do a full on analysis video, it would be so incredibly long, as there are so fricking many references here. Perhaps it would double the runtime of this already long video. That could be an interesting community project, if I think about it.\u0003@toasty I think he shoots some scenes ahead of time, but waits like a week before release to see if he has to change some of them or record new ones. He probably always works on multiple episodes at a time and has one or another already lying pretty finished on his drive just in case the next planned episode can&#39;t arrive on schedule or he wants to mess with the plan a bit.<br>I suppose he may already have some scenes finished for that ominous big special episode (or projects) he &quot;recruited&quot; artists for on Twitter all the way back in February/early March or so for instance.\u0003@Ben Craig Yeah, I might have just realized that, haven&#39;t noticed the &quot;tv&quot; there and that that was probably the joke...\u0003What exactly would Scott gain from that? I mean I think he already appeals to a more than broad audience and I don&#39;t think being on Netflix would somehow bring more people in, considering that most people who may be interested in this type of content are here on YouTube anyways. Moreover, I don&#39;t think the show would fit on Netflix all too well, I have the feeling it&#39;s more centered around YouTube than anything else, if he went to Netflix the episodes may have to be put more in line with each other in terms of length, so they can function as more of a series, which wouldn&#39;t function too well. As for the money, he doesn&#39;t really need it, Scott does seem to be a fairly grounded guy. He just &quot;needs&quot; to buy quite a lot of games and is able to sustain his lifestyle pretty well as it is. He probably wouldn&#39;t want to buy the biggest mansion or best and fastest car available and would rather donate that money to charity.\u0003@PurpleBoi I think he wants to keep his schedule with a weekly video at all costs starting from the yearly winter hiatus to Christmas episode which is why we also get some &quot;filler&quot; episodes from time to time. The Call of Duty DS episode was immediately before A Bargain Begin Christmas so he may have not had enough time to research as he had to finish the finale. Similarly, &quot;Chia Pet&quot; a couple of weeks prior or &quot;Speed Dating&quot; of the last season which seem a bit out of place, but don&#39;t require much research and only some clever but relatively quick writing and acting.\u0003Welp, better re-upload the entire video!\u0003"]], ["Blackpantsdude61", [17, "Maybe the original video was supposed to be an hour and a half\u0003The U in Wii U means U didn&#39;t play this console only the diehard fans did.\u0003Yeah skin tags for streaming games is a bad idea.\u0003This video already got 1M views in 3 days.

For such a highly praised side mode, most ideas don&#39;t have the originality as every other 3D Mario game.<br>Secondly, the enemies are all ripped from 3D World. Although everything has a unique design, which is very cool, I want some new enemy types to make this game feel at least a bit more distinguished. Plus, the only unique boss in this game is Fury Bowser, which is just a shame considering that Fury Bowser is actually really fun to fight!<br>Thirdly, the level theming for every island is really bland. It really doesn\u2019t have the same imagination we have seen from past 3D Mario games. The most variations we get in terms of level theming are a snow tower and a volcano. Heck, even Super Mario 3D Land offered more visual variety than this game. When compared to something like Super Mario Sunshine and its beach theme, Bowser&#39;s Fury and its cat theme doesn&#39;t offer much unfortunately.<br>Fourthly, the performance is quite bad...at least for a first party Nintendo game. Nintendo has been giving us very high quality, near perfect gaming experiences for over 3 decades now, and this game mode just isn&#39;t on the exact same level in terms of that polish we have come to expect. It lags so much during the Bowser Fury section that it&#39;s near impossible to not notice. Granted, it&#39;s not unplayable, but it sure isn&#39;t what I was expecting from this company.<br><br>Well, there&#39;s all of my complaints. I know it might just sound like unnecessary negativity, but you have to understand that Bowser&#39;s Fury is only obtaining immense critical praise, when it still has all of these little issues attached to it. I just wanted to inform you all with a new perspective. Thanks for listening if you reached this far.<br><br>P.S. As tempting as it might be, please don&#39;t report this as hate speech.\u0003@Triforce Jman Oh trust me, I can go on for hours complaining about modern Nintendo, but it just isn&#39;t relevant to Scott&#39;s current video.

Such as being able to glide, use runes and the flurry rush. It almost feels like a more action-oriented version of BotW at times, instead of just a Musou game with a Zelda skin like in the OG game. It also cuts a lot of the fat that the OG game had as well in order to make a much more compact and streamlined experience. I never felt inclined to 100% the OG Hyrule Warriors due to how much of a grind Adventure Mode was, whereas I was easily able to 100% AoC by following GameXPlain\u2019s Korok Seed guide. The OG game is better in that you basically have this large cast of Zelda characters across the series, rather than only the BotW ones, but the characters in AoC are still really fun and enjoyable in their own right.\u0003"]], ["Matthew", [15, "It&#39;s not hey y&#39;all?\u0003Old Man Yells At Cloud\u0003There&#39;s a clip of Larry Ellison from the &#39;90s ridiculing people for having to buy software off the shelf on plastic when it&#39;s just a bunch of ones and zeros that could be streamed to them.\u0003You ever see a sea sponge get siphoned?

If Nintendo listens to feedback, and god knows they need to, they would see how much people appreciated this addition to the game. It could potentially show them that not every new Mario game needs to be an epic 40 hour adventure. They could release 5-10 hour adventures every now and then and sell them for $20 dollars on the e-shop. It would be a good way for them to give us passion projects that people actually want to make in between the mass appeal garbage for babies like Odyssey. Can you imagine how much better Odyssey would have been if it didn\u2019t artificially pad it\u2019s run time with 800 Moons that had no challenge whatsoever associated with them and instead had 50-100 moons gained through well-crafted platforming gauntlets or interacting with the world or it\u2019s characters in some meaningful way? I really hope they do more things like Bowser\u2019s Fury in the future, especially with other IPs that don\u2019t really get enough love because Nintendo doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do with them (like Star Fox or Chibi Robo).

The meta-commentary, the fact that he somehow made a plot about a goddamn blue boarder very engaging, the songs, the jokes, the special effects, and most importantly of all, the tone. I don&#39;t think a Scott the Woz video felt as down to Earth and mature as this one. Yes of course there&#39;s comedy and the premise is very goofy, but this episode paints Scott in a more vulnerable position, where he realizes he&#39;s being tormented by the blue boarder, he wants it to go away, but than it effects the state of Ohio, so Scott must go on a quest to space to stop it, and than he realizes the boarder needs to be with someone, so Scott has to be the one to remain tortured by it, to prevent the blue boarder from effecting others. Sorry for coming across as pretentious, but I just got to talk about the tone. I feel like this is the most ambitious Scott video, somehow more ambitious than Awesome Baby, and that cannot be expressed enough. That&#39;s my review, no I&#39;m not giving a score, screw scores.\u0003I never thought Scott would tackle the dead Grunge genre, but he did a good job.

Complete edition re-release. Most games with substantial updates or DLC will eventually re-release the game with everything on disc (patches, DLC, etc). Now some do take the lazy route and just repack the old disc with a download code voucher (Spider-Man Game of the Year Edition and Nier Automata Game of YoRHa Edition being the most infuriating examples), but for the most part, that doesn&#39;t happen often. When they do complete editions, they&#39;re fully complete and they&#39;re all on disc. But the big problem with that is waiting a year or two for that re-release to happen and missing out on the initial hype.\u0003But you don&#39;t require internet to install the disc versions, which is good for preservation and long term enjoyment of these games.\u0003Funny enough Spyro on PS4 was reprinted to have all 3 games on disc and it also had a substantial size reduction to 36.24 GB.

What do you guys think about A super mario Death run game? If you don\u2019t know what death run is, it\u2019s a Gmod gamemode that you play with a small to large number of people. One to 3 people play as the killer who somewhere looking down upon the victims, There\u2019s traps set, and the killer has to click a button to Make the trap go, and if the victim doesn\u2019t get passed it they die for good or restart all the way at the beginning. And once you get to the end if you are a victim you get to kill the Killer. Idk, It\u2019s an interesting thing to me, to see a full fledged out mario version of that, I could see them making it 2d, 3d, even first person possibly, each person being able to choose characters from all across the mario franchise as their avatar, and People could make their own maps and unique traps. You could even earn some sort of revenue if you win and as it stacks up you could be able to afford accessory items in a shop with a huge variety of options that are updated often. There could also be a number of mini games within the very game itself.

The Wii U was a great console, unfortunately second only to the Vita for unloved-child syndrome dragging it into an early grave.<br><br>(At least the Vita had legions of fans and indie developers dragging it back out.)\u0003Remember when all you had to do, when you wanted to listen to music or watch a movie, was drop a disc in a tray and hit Play?

It was definitely bad.  But it wasn&#39;t <i>that</i> bad.  The level of ghosting visible in the GB Pocket shots seems closer to what I remember.  I suspect that the performance of that early panel has degraded significantly from its original specifications.\u0003@Pencil  I understand what you&#39;re saying.  But I think that&#39;s just a result of where the Japanese, and most of the world&#39;s culture was at in the late 80s.<br><br>A lot of languages, particularly Latin-origin languages, use gendered terms for any object.  Everyone knows a fork doesn&#39;t have any gender, but if you speak Spanish or Italian, for e.g., it does.  This doesn&#39;t mean anything, of course, it&#39;s just an idiosyncrasy of the language.  My guess is the &quot;Game Boy&quot; is derived from this long-standing tendency to assign gender to inanimate objects, rather arbitrarily.<br><br>I think American culture right now is getting so fixated on breaking gender norms and stereotypes, that the relevance of gendered nouns is being hyper scrutinized.  It has been a thing for centuries, and you can look at it as being a result of cultural patriarchies, or a quirk that has no significance at all.  The western world seems to have veered toward the former in the last couple decades.<br><br><br>But in 1989... &quot;Game Boy&quot; was just more approachable than &quot;Non-Gendered Game Thing.&quot;  Maybe if it came out now, it would be &quot;Game They?&quot;  :-)\u0003Actually, no.  That whole bit about Tetris appealing to everybody -- that was quite the point.  It wasn&#39;t a violent &quot;kill the bad guys&quot; game, so it was intended to attract non-traditional gamers -- which means, older and more femaler audiences.  :-)  Maybe it wasn&#39;t a perfect appeal to gender neutrality, but it was a step.

For that matter, why did they announce a 3DS remake of Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#39;s Inside Story <i>in 2018?</i> The Switch was already out at that point, and when the game released almost a year later, the 3DS was well and truly dead. The game had abysmal sales, not only being the worst selling Mario &amp; Luigi title, but also one of the worst selling Mario games in general. They <i>had</i> to have lost money on that one.

You&#39;re being ridiculous.\u0003@Elijah Tang-Spigelman all those games are online though. And always will be. Sure, not through legal channels necessarily, but they are there. That&#39;s how, at the end of the day, games are going to be preserved. <br><br>Like that N64 cart for 1.5 mil isn&#39;t because they just desperately need to play the game and that&#39;s the only way, but for the collectors aspect of it. As a showpiece. Which is a bit different. <br><br>And as far as reselling your games, you won&#39;t be able to do that for games going back to the 360 and PS3, if it requires any downloading what so ever. (If the store shuts down) Which they often do these days. And if you can&#39;t finish downloading the game files, that disc is useless other than as a potential collectors piece.<br><br> And there&#39;s just really no way of getting around that. New games often NEED those downloads. Either it won&#39;t fit on the disc, or there was a game breaking bug that needed to be patched, or the dev just decided not to ship the whole.gsme in disc. <br><br>There&#39;s pros and cons to both. But as far as pure preservation of playable games, digital is the solution. And I&#39;m taking long term. 50 years from now. <br><br>Like how do we play most classic games now as consumers? Remasters and digital rereleases and collections. Not from the orginal hardware. Especially for things like arcade games and consoles that didn&#39;t sell all that well like the 3do or old PC stuff like Amiga\u0003@Elijah Tang-Spigelman Sony IS still shutting down the store. They just delayed it one more year. But, like I said, those carts will not always be functional. It&#39;s been happening a lotttt lately for gbc/PS1 era and before. <br><br>Lots of people do repairs to their carts now. Especially when they have battery saves attached. <br><br>This is happening with consoles too. And like with the nes, they don&#39;t even make parts anymore, st all. Used only. And obviously that won&#39;t last. <br><br>Your games might survive longer than other peoples, but the point is, if you&#39;re under 30, more than likely prettyyyy much all your games will fail or the consoles themsleves. The consoles will probably fail first. And you won&#39;t always be able to repair them, cause they will stop making parts eventually. <br><br>Point is, as far as physical software and electronics are concerned, it won&#39;t last. <br><br>Yes, they will shut down platform stores  at some point and support for certain hardware. BUT companies like Microsoft has done a lot lately to make sure your purchases across generation, across decades, stay with you. So as long as Microsoft exists, your purchases will. <br><br>You also have the fact that people evetuallyyyy, upload basically every game ever made online at some point. There&#39;s tonssss of games that are no longer in print and super rare, that are available only online. <br><br>Our games will be preserved digitally, legally or otherwise. That&#39;s how we keep them. It&#39;s very VERY unlikely that games will disappear from the internet. You&#39;ll have access to them one way or the other digitally.\u0003Don&#39;t think for a second that having physical preserves games more than digital downloads. <br><br>It factually doesn&#39;t.

But it has its many drawbacks, DRM, limited selection, and storage requirements among them. Physical media continues to die out for movies and music, but fortunately the used game market ensures that physical games will persist for the foreseeable future. Without the convenience of purchasing used games from GameStop or your local game store, many games would become hard to obtain, as copies would disappear from store shelves when the game goes out of print, and there would not be a surge in listings on sites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace since most games would have little demand; the ability to browse the selection that is afforded by game stores results in people selecting games they may not have had interest in before. Of course, many games are not available on digital storefronts, and of those that are, the consumer is forced to pay whatever the specified price is, typically full price, whereas with physical games they have the choice of purchasing a used copy for a lower price.\u0003Alternative title: Scott spends thousands of dollars on Nintendo Stupid Headache Machine that he doesn&#39;t even really like\u0003As someone from Maine I sorta felt that.
