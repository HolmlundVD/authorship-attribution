In a King-and-pawns endgame, don&#39;t push your pawns until you need to. Case in point: White&#39;s f pawn, which stayed on f2 until Magnus needed to move it in order to retain opposition and tempo.

I think they don&#39;t even get it.\u0003Capablanca games are boring\u0003Do we at least have the illustration somewhere?\u0003History repeating itself... ;-)\u0003Yes, they&#39;re sort of chess twins a century apart (although Morphy wasn&#39;t tall). <br>But their chess careers and achievements are indeed weirdly similar. Both Americans, both geniuses and by far the strongest players of their day and both quit chess far too early, ending up somewhat deranged. <br>The main difference is that Bobby studied chess day and night from the age of 7 whereas Morphy never studied chess at all which makes Bobby the most obsessed and Morphy the most talented player of all times.\u0003They were the most respectful Gentlemen towards each other one can imagine. Anderssen never tried to find excuses like Horwitz or Staunton did, on the contrary. He was quoted in Bell\u2019s Life in London of January 2, 1859 saying \u201cMorphy is too strong for any living player to hope to win more than a game here and there.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>And this is what an observer wrote about Anderssen:<br>&quot;I have never seen a nobler-hearted gentleman than Herr Anderssen. He would sit at the board, examining the frightful positions into which Morphy had forced him, until his whole face was radiant with admiration of his antagonist\u2019s strategy, and, positively laughing outright, he would commence resetting the pieces for another game, without a remark. To others he was loud in admiration of the young American.&quot;\u0003there has never been and there will never be any chess player more talented than Morphy. <br>Put your so called &quot;more skilled&quot; guys into a time machine, take them back to their childhood and then don&#39;t let them study chess day and night and just play based on their natural strength. <br>Then we&#39;ll see where they end up with their &quot;skill&quot; compared to Morphy.\u0003He was considered as the strongest in the 30ies, like some sort of World Champion although the title didn&#39;t exist at the time, after having defeated McDonnell in a series of matches.\u0003hahaha !! Excellent! :-)))\u0003It&#39;s not even questionable\u0003@Gerald Montagna so your game strategy is pretty straightforward: First knight hunting, then bishop hunting! :-)\u0003Yes, you&#39;re expressing here the fundamental principle that bishops are better in open positions and knights in closed ones.<br>It&#39;s also depending upon whether your opponent has a good or a bad bishop (= blocked by his own pawns)<br>In closed positions, if you manage to put a Monster knight (=defended by pawn and can&#39;t be attacked by opponent&#39;s pawn) into the center it could be easily stronger than a rook.\u0003Here&#39;s what Anderssen had to say about Morphy after the match to a reporter:<br>\u201cI consider Mr. Morphy the finest chess player who ever existed. He is far superior to any now living, and would doubtless have beaten Labourdonnais himself. In all his games with me, he has not only played, in every instance, the exact move, but the most exact. He never makes a mistake (Morphy, present, here quietly smiled); but, if his adversary commits the slightest error, he is lost.\u201d\u0003@Christian Bensel Good question! I automatically assumed it would have been in English, but after all they were in Paris and Morphy spoke fluently French, so it might also have been French. <br>I&#39;m not sure though whether Anderssen spoke any French whereas he definitely spoke English.\u0003Yes, Anderssen translated this German idiom verbatim, probably unaware that there is no direct equivalent in English, it should have rather been something like &quot;I have two already in the bag&quot;\u0003@Partha Sadhu So? The fact still stands that your original comment &quot;why arent you covering current tournaments&quot; was bonkers since it implies that agad doesn&#39;t cover ANY current tournaments, which is obviously not the case because he covers a whole lot of current tournaments. <br><br>The correct question should then have been &quot;Agadmator, why aren&#39;t you covering ALL current tournaments?&quot; <br><br>And the answer to this even I can tell you: because he is not obliged to.<br><br>This is not a Reuters tournament reporting service. Agad can chose whatever he feels like covering at any old time, so if he has the impression that people are getting a bit bored with all this modern stuff , it&#39;s perfectly legitimate to intersperse it with some &quot;good stuff&quot; of old for a change....\u0003@Partha Sadhu oh, that was just because you were asking such a silly question since agadmator kept covering practically all important current tournaments one after the other. <br>So your question is a bit like &quot;why does the sun not rise in the morning&quot;. So as I said: a bit bonkers.\u0003Are you bonkers?\u0003@inserte Su nombre you mean Lasker vs. Thomas 1912?\u0003How great for you, mate, I totally envy you, wish I could come along! \r<br>I could still kick myself for not doing exactly the same when I was in New Orleans 2 years ago!\u0003you mean without further ado....?\u0003@Jaap van der Tuuk well, obviously there was no official worldchampionsmatch before 1886, but I think it&#39;s still legitimate to consider the 1866 match as some (inofficial) worldchampionship, just like Anderssen-Morphy 1858, Anderssen-Staunton 1851, Staunton-St.Amant 1843, Labourdonnais-McDonnell 1834, etc pp. which were also not official worldchampionships but had a simliar level of significance.<br><br>After all, the two were the two strongest active players at the time with  Morphy having forfeited his &quot;title&quot; by simply not playing, just like Fischer a century later (must be an American thing this ....:-))<br><br>So, although the title &quot;World Champion&quot; didn&#39;t exist at the time, I believe it was perceived in the same way: a contest of two players who were considered to be the strongest to decide which one&#39;s the best.\u0003That&#39;s really a great idea!!! Seconded!\u0003Now imagine how Staunton would have fared who got his arse kicked by Anderssen already in 1851!\u0003@inserte Su nombre That&#39;s right, which can be easily demonstrated  by looking at Morphy&#39;s historical peak ELO rating of 2765 (with Fischer topping the list at an all time peak rate of 2895).<br>Given the fact that Fischer studied chess day and night and Morphy not at all it&#39;s safe to assume that, had Morphy ever studied chess seriously, particularly with our modern knowledge and methods, he could have exceeded Fischer&#39;s score with ease.\u0003@inserte Su nombre But he would be easily with modern chess knowledge\u0003He&#39;s the Messiah of Caissa!\u0003The top 20 is fairly easy as it would be mostly congruent with the list of World Champions. <br>It becomes much trickier to select from those say the top 5!<br><br>My Top 5 would include: Morphy, Fischer, Aljechin, Tal, Kasparov and Carlsen,\u0003Many sacrifices can&#39;t be calculated till the final mate, they are called strategic sacrifices. It&#39;s up to the player&#39;s  assessment based on his expericence and feel for the position whether to risk it or not. A typical example is Bobby&#39;s spectacluar Queen sacrifice against Donald Byrne. It&#39;s never possible to calculate something like this through to the final mating position, one has to trust one&#39;s positional feeling to decide whether to risk it or not. Bobby did and won in fantastic style, Anderssen risked it and didn&#39;t succeed. With a lesser player it might have worked but not against Morphy. <br><br>A different story are tactical sacrifices which are forced lines that lead to an unavoidable mate in a certain number of moves. It takes a bit of compuation but is far easier to assess. It either works or it doesn&#39;t. Take Edward Lasker&#39;s famous Queen sacrifice against Thomas in 1912 where the black king had to walk all the way down to white&#39;s first rank and could have been mated by castles queenside. That is a certain mate in about 8 moves, no possibility for black to avoid it. There is no grey area in this type of cases, that&#39;s why the weaker side usually then resigns.\u0003@Rocky davil jee neet absolutely! He had no idea about how to use the internet!\u0003that&#39;s how it should be!\u0003@Gioele Snider It was the first time for anyone in that era to play such a strong player\u0003It&#39;s the Prussian flag. <br>Germany didn&#39;t exist at the time since the second German empire was only founded in 1871 and the first one had been destroyed by Napoleon in 1805.\u0003@Gm Pillo Exactly. I find this amazing. Today we consider these the crucial years to become a GM\u0003@Cold Truth I&#39;m not denying it, Fischer is definitely the greatest when it comes to single handedly bringing down Soviet Chess dominance.<br><br>But just have a look again what I wrote: <br><br>When you do a ratio of greatness divided by the amount of study time put into it, no-one beats Morphy. It&#39;s simple Maths, Even if Fischer in absolute terms is better, which he probably is, as he stood on the shoulder of giants, Morphy&#39;s ratio is undeniably better since Fischer studied chess almost 24/7 whereas Morphy studied about 0. <br><br>So let&#39;s say Fischer is 10 and Morphy is 9. Fischer puts 10 hours study into chess and Morphy only 1. Then Fischer&#39;s ratio is 10/10 = 1 whereas Morphy&#39;s is 9/1 = 9. Are you getting what I&#39;m trying to illustrate? I&#39;m not criticising Fischer as I also consider him to be the greatest, but when it comes to sheer natural talent, no-one beats Morphy!\u0003True, but it all depends on which criteria you apply... ;-)<br>Bobby did hardly anything else other than studying chess from the age of 7 years onward. Chess was basically his life, so it&#39;s only half surprising that he was so good.<br>Morphy on the other hand never studied chess so he is beyond the shadow of a doubt the greatest natural talent that ever lived.\u0003Not too surprising when two masters of this caliber clash... ;-) <br>A battle of two titans and really fascinating to watch, especially as Anderssen was still on par with Morphy in this game.\u0003And what about Count Isidor? :-)\u0003Staunton did not invent the chessset that is named after him, he just lent his name to it as the inofficial WC at the time. <br>The actual inventor, Nathaniel Cooke, thought it to be a great Marketing gimmick, which turned out to be correct as they are today the undisputed official pieces worldwide.<br><br>Also let&#39;s not forget that, while he was able to create a few nice tactical combinations here and there, they&#39;re a far cry of what Anderssen and Morphy were able to do and leave the spectator with a bit of a feeling of disappointment when compared to those two in terms of complexity and beauty. It&#39;s quite a significant difference.\u0003@Giri Iyer Yes, exactly, that&#39;s the one! <br>If I remember correctly, young Morphy opened one game with a3 and one with a4 and won them all so the General was truly pissed of, being humiliated in such a fashion after he had already been piqued when they presented the little boy to him as &quot;strongest player in New Orleans&quot;.... :-)))<br>I believe the story is authentic, it was recorded somewhere, even the games have sort of survived, it might not be 100% accurate but at least we have a rough idea how they went .\u0003@Youtubenightcrawler I&#39;m actually not so sure why you keep depicting Staunton as some sort of master of the closed position. When you go through his game list, the vast majority are open games, all the usual Kingspawn game suspects e.g. Evans, Italian, Kings Gambit, Petrov, Scandi, 2Knights, what have you, etc. there&#39;s the odd half open game like French and Sicilian whereas truly closed games are only few and far between.<br><br>And even if it was the case, Staunton&#39;s style in general just doesn&#39;t look convincing. He often seems to change his approach in the middle of a game for no apparent reason, almost as if not really sure how to proceed, whereas Anderssen and Morphys games usually leave an impression of being from one single cast.<br><br>As for game 8 and 10, it&#39;s actually quite funny that he seemed to have these difficulties against a3 because he had won himself as a boy against the general who visited New Orleans to play the strongest player in N.O. with the very same opening upon which the General stormed off.... :-)\u0003Fully agree, I think it&#39;s the Mozartesque simplicity and lightness of his style which makes it look so easy in hindsight, but who of us mortals would ever be able to pull it of in such manner?\u0003@Sai Kiran Absolutely, me for one am 100% convinced that Morphy was the greatest natural talent that ever walked the earth. <br>The ease with which he came up with these stunning combinations tells me that his brain must have been perfectly wired and particularly suited for chess as he must have had some very unique spacial awareness of the chessboard and the pieces&#39; movements which is beyond us mortals.\u0003Bearing in mind that Morphy never studied any theory and was able to beat the best of the time with such ease, it becomes pretty obvious that no one would stand a chance if he ever cared to take in modern theory as professionally as modern GMs do.\u0003No, that was Dr. Tarrasch, Das Schachspiel.. ;-)\u0003poor Paul...!\u0003@Srinivas Sridhar &quot;how can you not make a move in chess? Do you say Pass or just skip??&quot;<br><br>Obviously you can&#39;t do that as it&#39;s against the rules, and I didn&#39;t say you should do it, it&#39;s just a hypothetical thought experiment and the easiest test to find out whether a position is Zugzwang or not. <br><br>In case you&#39;re capable of following such concepts of abstract thinking, that&#39;s what you have to do: <br><br>Simply imagine (and again, especially for you: this is hyphothetical!) that the weaker side would not make any moves at all, could the stronger side then still win or not?<br><br>If yes, it&#39;s not Zugzwang\r<br>If no, it&#39;s Zugzwang.\r<br><br>That&#39;s really the easiest way I can explain it to you, if you don&#39;t understand it like this I&#39;ll have to refer you to sombody else.<br><br>In the proper Zugzwang example I posted above, White can only win because Black is forced to move the King away from the protection of his bishop. Otherwise, the King could never approach the bishop and if black didn&#39;t make any moves (hypothetically!) White couldn&#39;t make progress and it would be a draw. <br><br>So it is Zugzwang.<br><br>But in the game above, White is not depending on black to make moves. Even if all (Black!) pieces stayed put (again, especially for you: this is hypothetical!) he would be able to win. <br><br>So it&#39;s not Zugzwang.<br><br>These are two fundamentally different situations. Do you even get the difference or is this all completely over your head? If yes, ask someone else, maybe Agadmator, as I don&#39;t seem to be able to get you to grasp this qualitative distinction between the two scenarios.\u0003@Srinivas Sridhar &quot;when your opponent has no useful, active moves, and is losing the game positionally, then it&#39;s a zugzwang&quot; <br><br>That&#39;s what many people believe to be the case but but it&#39;s in fact totally wrong and couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.<br><br>I posted the definition above, just read it again. It&#39;s only Zugzwang when you lose because you have to make a move.<br><br>You can actually easily decide for yourself&gt;<br><br>Does Black lose because he has to make a move? Then it&#39;s Zugzwang<br><br>Or can White win even without Black having to make any moves? Then it&#39;s not Zugzwang.<br><br>In this case, even if the bishop stayed put on d8, White can easily get his King closer, attack the bishop and promote the pawn. Even if black didn&#39;t make any moves at all. He is not depending on black to make moves in order to win. So there&#39;s no way for this to be classified as Zugzwang.\u0003@Justin Marin <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLITd9fcS88&amp;t=07m40s\">07:40</a> &quot;look at this amazing knight! ... it cannot be challenged there.&quot;<br>the implied continuation here is &quot;... by any pawn&quot;.

The pain, the pain\u2026 Anderssen is playing a solitary violin whilst Morphy has the whole orchestra at his command. The result a lot of dramatic but ineffective moves by Anderssen whilst Morphy simply over whelms with consummate ease.Oh dear, it seems outside the bounds of the match Anderssen is willing to try (absolutely) any avenue of attack or defence - or even both at the same time - but to no avail. If he wasn\u2019t known as a Master, he might be sent back to school. But then Morphy has a \u2018talent\u2019 for potentially making any adversary look almost a novice. You really have to a Mensch, or at least a real gentleman, to continually play against Morphy. Anderssen certainly is at least one of those things. (Stockard, on the other hand, comes across as \u2026. well, as a weasel perhaps !? ). Kudos to Anderssen for walking into the fire time and time again. // Thanks Agad, great games, great story.\u0003Anderssen throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, (as we say the Uk), at Morphy, but he still doesn\u2019t really put Morphy in danger, but it makes for a very dramatic game. And thanks to Agad for showing us such a rich seam of Chess history.\u0003Another Fantastic Game, thanks Agad\u0003Amazing. I can\u2019t quite believe such a complicated game was created in so few moves with such an conventional start. Once I\u2019ve replaced a few blown fuses in my brain, I\u2019ll watch it again to try to understand and follow how it all exploded so fast. This, I imagine, is what Chess would be like on the mind altering drugs Aldous Huxley experimented with in the 1950\u2019s; almost unworldly. Thanks Agad.\u0003It seems that the more Chess Masters look into Morphy\u2019s eyes - or soul - the worse they play. Is Morphy some kind of hypnotising snake ?  Andersen was almost walking his pieces back from any engagement or attack. Very strange. Perhaps Morphy is a Time Lord, one of Dr Who\u2019s regenerations they haven\u2019t film yet ?!!\u0003Gosh, what a wonderful game !  But I do feel that Andersen is feeling the pressure of his losses and not always playing with full confidence in his own abilities. Also, as Agad says, he rather desperately wants a win and so doesn\u2019t pursue Drawing chances.\u0003Cool match, but Morphy marches on !!\u0003Morphy back on form and now understands more of how Andersen plays Chess .. I predict a Riot !\u0003I would have thought that, at this stage of the game, a Q for two Rooks won\u2019t necessarily be the end of the road. White could only get one Check and then Black could block or move to an uncheckable position; certainly not a winning position unless Black contrived to get a Rook on White\u2019s back rack, but Morphy is light years from falling for such simplistic manoeuvres // Great Game. The tables begin to turn, slightly. Thanks Agad.\u0003Interesting game, but Morphy clearly not on top form. He may get notional \u2018bonus points\u2019 for going ahead with the match despite ill health, but one of the attractions of Chess is that it is an absolute sport, there is no; there an be no discussion, about Winning or losing, or drawing. This was a win for Anderson. By the by, wasn\u2019t Anderson the name of the evil agent(s) in The Matrix ?!\u0003As the Man said, an awesome game. I will watch it again and again, but I did get both \u2018pause the video\u2019 questions, so that makes me - in my little chess mind - if not quite awesome, then at least \u2018Ok\u2019, and that\u2019s fine.

(And I found the castle move; very pleased with myself\u2026. ).\u0003Masterly control by Carlsen, to an almost embarrassing degree. But it\u2019s very hard to stop, or even delay, a fully loaded runaway freight train - anything it crashes into is just reduced to smithereens, (little tiny tiny twisted pieces of debris\u2026).\u0003A titanic struggle between two Masters. Even when the end game has been waging for a while, still it is unclear who will win, or even if a win is a likely outcome. But it\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t David vs Goliath; rather Goliath vs Goliath, a struggle between two absolute giants of the game. (Thanks Agad).\u0003Very interesting game, thanks.

But the day is coming Mr Carlsen, and you know it. But that is perhaps the tragedy of being World Champion, you become the target - the ultimate \u2018scalp\u2019. And one day the King must fall.

But he didn\u2019t\u2019 and the game carried on, but now with the emphasis on \u2018saving the Bishop\u2019. And so for the want of a Bishop, the Game was lost.

Dubov moves his pieces with such ease, confident and sophistication it\u2019s difficult to keep up with the ever changing web of inter-relationships between his pieces. And the threat of danger passes between at least eight pieces with just a single move of one of them; like the many headed hydra, each piece, almost in turn, threatens the end for Black. Even Black\u2019s capture of major pieces seems to have no effect on White\u2019s March to victory. Astonishingly.\u0003Amazingly intricate and clever play - excellent game !

never in trouble. and Magnus definitely a bigger favorite as time control goes down.Dubov is not going to be WC, he is too aggressive, Nepo doesn&#39;t have the best chance, he is not even the strongest challenger right now, Fabi was the strongest challenger and he couldn&#39;t win a single game against Magnus, Magnus is still strongest and here to stay.\u0003that&#39;s how it works, equal to the champ is not enough, you have to beat the champ to take his title, not be equal to him, you can be equal but you will go home in second place, and Magnus is strongest in all time formats, it&#39;s just another reason he is champ.<br><br>The World Championship match isn&#39;t to see who is the best, we know who the best is, the champ is the best, the WC match is to see if anyone else is better, if anyone dares to challenge and beat the champ, so far no one has proven stronger than Magnus, so Magnus will remain champ until someone can beat him or until he retires unbeatable.\u0003Armageddon, with white 5 min, black 4 min, no time increment.\u0003I think Duda and Karjakin will get into the Candidates,\u0003Esipenko took Mangus to blitz, but Magnus was never really under pressure, he was always in control and just played risk free knowing that eventually he will easily pick Esipenko apart in faster time formats, Magnus probably will do the same with Duda and then Karjakin.\u0003at that point it was already completely losing for black and he resigned on move 39, one move before they get more time, so makes sense, he didn&#39;t want to prolong a lost game especially since he needs a win anyway, which was impossible at that point.\u0003not only Magnus but Magnus is the strongest so least likely to lose with white in classical.\u0003Magnus just played the best moves, it&#39;s just what he does.\u0003Magnus: I want Marshall Attack.<br>Bacrot: OK, I will play the Anti Marshall to stop your Marshall Attack.<br>Magnus: Good luck with that.\u0003Because  black just move his queen c6, threatening checkmate and if white defend with rook, black checks king in the corner and then picks up the other rook in the other corner completely winning.\u0003just like real life, queens are mostly useless.\u0003Esipenko only won 1 game against Magnus in classical, this was a rapid game, but Esipenko is a great talent\u0003The king must fall indeed unless he retires, Magnus is not at this point yet, he still has some years in him, but I think he will know when it&#39;s time to call it quits.\u0003whites king is exposed and black queen would just check, check, check and win a bunch of material, even can win the queen or mate if white is not careful, but yes taking the rook right away in that position is not even the best move, checking king again and capturing kingside pawns with check is even better, but either way that position is completely winning for black.\u0003Magnus doesn&#39;t struggle with him, Esipenko is just that good, very solid GM, especially in classical, but of course  Magnus is best in all time formats and grind down the opponent eventually.\u0003that&#39;s the real Magnus that we like and love.\u0003Duda\u0003It&#39;s very unlikely to win in maniac style especially in longer time formats, not a good strategy especially if you are the strongest GM, everyone is very well prepared and knows much more thanks to technology, so Magnus&#39;s way is the only sure way of consistently winning, it might not be flashy and cool, but a win is a win even if it takes you 8 games to break your opponent down.\u0003He did great to get that far, but it was always a losing battle, the shorter the time the bigger advantage for Magnus.\u0003Yep, and they don&#39;t really play classical, all the classical players are weaker than Magnus in shorter time controls, that&#39;s why Magnus is #1, strongest in every time control, makes it very very hard to dethrone him.\u0003I don&#39;t get why

He did not play it,(except once, I believe) bcoz it leads to boring,and generally to a drawish continuation.Morphy is simply unstoppable on the board and irresistible off it. It&#39;s impossible to take your eyes off the proceedings. Once Morphy starts with e4 you know something spectacular is going to take place. And then I go back again and again to check.\u0003MORPHY was damn lucky in this game. So many mistakes, almost so close to winning,even a draw begging to be taken\u0003MORPHY, I&#39;m sure must have analysed the previous three games,must have worked out anderssen&#39;s game plan and came out with his refutation,his own line to deal with Anderssen. Note, both are like two wild cats meeting on neutral territory,going around in circles,feeling each other. This was a workmanlike victory,nothing spectacular,but when you look at the time period,very engrossing. MORPHY simplifying it to an easy endgame.\u0003@Mitch Jestice when two artists duel,they either resort to the lowest denominator,butchery,or they play risk free,shake hands,go for a draw. Anderssen is not a fool to fall for his king&#39;s or Evans gambit <a href=\"http://traps.so/\">traps.so</a> Morphy will have to go for staid positional games like we have in the modern era.\u0003Loewenthal travelled with Morphy wherever Morphy and covered his games. Some of the records are his. However it should be noted that (in the light of his comments on Morphy&#39;s moves and that of his opponent&#39;s) he was kicked out of London 1851 by a relatively unknown rookie,a wildcard entry by I believe named Williams (I&#39;m not sure about the name though). So much for his idiotic comments.\u0003I don&#39;t know,but Anderssen should not have resigned after taking two rooks for the Queen. The situation in my opinion was still equallish,with a slight adv. For white. He could have fought on and may be obtained a tough draw with some luck. I think agad sir should have checked the engine line from move twenty.\u0003Anderssen in this game is like an old man standing on the edge of the wall and a young boy sneaks up from behind and says boo and he falls down. For all his attack attack attack and tactical brilliance, Anderssen is forgetful. This is not the first time. In another match (probably London 1851) Staunton sneaked up a silly CM,which anyone would have noticed,when Anderssen was quite easily winning. This move by Morphy was one of those moves, which Anderssen could have easily avoided,after playing so well till then. Of course my opinion alone.thks.\u0003@Gm Pillo though I&#39;m not well versed in 1850&#39;s history,but I think Morphy did go through la bourdannay and some others and even annotated some of his games. But that doesn&#39;t prove he studied chess seriously. But it is remarkable that without studying chess seriously (almost nil actually) they got so strong.\u0003Whew! It&#39;s quite a complex/complicated line that these two played,at least with my limited knowledge. I&#39;m watching it again and may have to a few more times to get the gist of the matter.\u0003@Dr. Bluesfield yes,well said. But, actually Morphy is feeling him out,getting to understand his <a href=\"http://playstyle.it/\">playstyle.it</a> has happened against others too,losing the first game or so. Being unlettered in theory,he only has his own innate sense of intuition to figure out his opponents,and work out a way to take them on.\u0003No, I believe they played in a grand hotel room where Morphy was bedridden and the moves were relayed on boards outside for people to follow. I forget the name of the hotel though. That&#39;s what I read a long time back. But you&#39;ll have to check the details though,and correct me if I&#39;m wrong.\u0003Notice one thing,when Morphy loses,it is usually sixty-seventy odd moves,after a bitter fight to the end,never by total domination. He was a stubborn fighter. Great quality in any game,leave alone chess.\u0003I don&#39;t know,but Morphy looks more like Tintin in this colour painting.\u0003Well,one point you didn&#39;t mention. Anderssen was a thorough gentleman. He offered to postpone the match till Morphy recovered from his illness,but Morphy refused and decided to continue.\u0003@Arpi MorFischer first,thks for your reply. Well,what you have said is true, Morphy simply destroyed Anderssen, supposedly the best in his era. Were it not for the fact that Morphy was very ill,the scoreline would have probably read 9-0, of that I&#39;m sure. And it is said that Anderssen actually started playing better than before after his series with Morphy. But you must remember one thing, Anderssen was 40 at the time. But, I believe,even if he were only twenty five, I think he would still have lost to Morphy. After watching over two hundred games of Morphy, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that Morphy was on a level all his own. I don&#39;t know and it&#39;s my opinion alone,but I think the way Morphy played chess,no one comes even close to him in terms of understanding the piece dynamics,the positional value and the tactics and the strategies involved in a game,leave alone the calculation of the permutations and combinations of different variations,of which he was the absolute master. To me,he was the very embodiment of romantic era chess,the epitome of all that is artistic, exquisitely creative and beautiful about,nay,the soul and spirit of chess. The goat,what else can I say. The reason I&#39;m a huge fan of Morphy and consider him the no. One followed by Fischer and of course capa. Of course all my opinion. No one has to agree with me. Thks for your reply, have a good day.\u0003No, I think Anderssen vs Steinitz is 14-14=0. But check the records.\u0003After the first two games, Morphy commented that the Evans gambit is busted. After that,he never played the Evans Gambit against Anderssen.\u0003@Ch Ts if so,then I shall certainly check it out.\u0003There is the Mozart of chess by Jessica Fischer and the life and chess of Morphy by Lucas Anderson. Both are good docus.\u0003Actually, I believe it is a colour painting of Morphy by a painter named Carvalho,while playing an exhibition with him in, I believe new york museum,or some such famous monument in 1867. That&#39;s the only colour painting of Morphy. But you&#39;ll have to check the Wikipedia for the details.\u0003As tartakower once famously said&quot;I&#39;ve never won a match against anyone who was not in good good health at that time&quot;.heh heh.\u0003Well, I believe even alekhine avoided JRC, but it&#39;s not so written about when talking about chess history&#39;,or maybe slipped from public memory.

These schemes might work with a lesser player, but Morphy parries them -- all the way not giving up his own offense for the sake of defense.@Kleydson Ferreira You&#39;d think that by the second match, Anderssen knows just how great Morphy is, that he can&#39;t get away with moves that might work with lesser players.  Nevertheless, he seems to be underestimating him even worse than in the first match -- strange.  Unless it&#39;s that he&#39;s just playing crazy, the way you do against an engine when you know you have no hope and just have to do bizarre things.\u0003What about Black G4-G3, and then protecting the F4 pawn with Black&#39;s bishop at H6?  Bring the rook to G8 and then prepare to castle queenside.  Does this work?\u0003There&#39;s a theme in this game that Agadmator didn&#39;t mention, which is that trading your bishop for a knight early in the game is only worthwhile if either you go up by a pawn or two or if you can trade a knight for a bishop soon.  If you end up at move 40 with a bishop and a knight and your opponent has a pair of bishops from hell in lockstep, you&#39;re done for.  It may look playable at move 40, but in the 50s the power of the bishops from hell will be unstoppable and your knight won&#39;t help you much at all.  So if one is forced to trade his bishop for a knight, it damned well better be to win the game in the next 10 moves -- either that or use a knight to hunt down a bishop ASAP.\u0003@Dr. Bluesfield Well, I don&#39;t have to hunt down a bishop if I&#39;m able to trade off both my knights for both of Stockfish&#39;s knights; I only hunt down a bishop if I create an imbalance.  Stockfish is not undefeatable, but you can&#39;t let it play its game, then you have no chance at all.  I&#39;ve never played a human remotely as devastating as Stockfish with its knights.  So my entire opening pattern is trying to squeeze the engine&#39;s knights into a place where I can trade them off the board ASAP.\u0003@Dr. Bluesfield When I play Stockfish on Lichess, I find its knightplay so devastating in closed positions that it leads to my defeat or inevitable defeat within 20 moves.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve evolved a strategy of taking them off the board within 15 moves at most.  Sometimes I have to give up one of my bishops to accomplish this.  But I also find that I&#39;ve got to negate that by move 40.  It doesn&#39;t have to be done instantly, but it&#39;s got to be done by move 30-35; hunting down a bishop becomes my prime directive.  I can beat Stockfish if both of its knights are off the board and if it doesn&#39;t have the advantage of a bishop over a knight as of move 40. But it will beat me early if I leave its knights on the board, and it will beat me soon after 40 if it has a bishop and I only have a knight.<br><br>And of course, never let your opponent assemble a bishops-from-hell combo!\u0003Fabulous!  Now that&#39;s the Morphy I know!  I really don&#39;t think he was fully recovered from his illness the first six or seven matches.  Now he&#39;s playing like an engine once again.  He dissected Black&#39;s weaknesses the way Stockfish dissects mine.  I would never have see F2-E3, that ended the game.\u0003Does anyone these days still bring out the queen to start roaming around the board all alone?  It&#39;s a great way to lose a queen.\u0003You people who are thumbs-downing a chess analysis, what&#39;s up with that?  Who would do such a thing?  (Maybe Agadmator&#39;s competitors?)  I can&#39;t imagine doing that to any chess reviewer, even one who does nothing more than state the obvious and say &quot;uh&quot; after every two words.  Agadmator explains the rationale behind nearly every move, and only very rarely fails to explain one that I wish he had.  Furthermore, he provides all this information with wit and humor entertainingly -- which the other commentators don&#39;t.  What possible complaint could anyone have that would justify a thumbs-down?\u0003I don&#39;t think Morphy has been healthy at any point in this match.  Even his two wins were unimpressive.  In games 1-4 I didn&#39;t see any brilliant moves from him, his best was just solid positional play that took advantage of Anderssen&#39;s overaggressiveness.  A damned shame!  This is nowhere near Morphy at his best.\u0003Maybe I don&#39;t understand.  It seemed to me that Anderssen sacrificed his knight to break down Morphy&#39;s defense in front of the king, but that he could have calculated that it would not result in a checkmate if defended by someone competent.  (Me, he would have checkmated.)  Was he rash?  Did he miscalculate?  Did he underestimate Morphy?  Once Anderssen&#39;s assault fizzled out, even I could have won just by trading down.\u0003@Dr. Bluesfield &quot;With a lesser player it might have worked but not against Morphy. &quot;  Well that&#39;s exactly my point!  You don&#39;t underestimate your opponent when calculating a sacrifice.  Sure, the sacrifice would&#39;ve beaten ME, Stockfish gets me all the time in those positions (on Lichess).  But it was risky and assumed the opponent would make a mistake enabling it to succeed, don&#39;t you think so?  Morphy knew how to wriggle out of it.  It was also an all-or-nothing sacrifice, because if it failed to achieve its end all Morphy had to do was to trade down to queen a pawn and win.  I personally couldn&#39;t have wriggled out of the sacrifice, but once Morphy wriggled out of it I could have picked up from there and won using the same approach as Morphy.  As Gimli quipped in the LOTR movie: &quot;Small chance of success.  What are we waiting for?&quot;\u0003OK Vegeta\u0003Could someone please explain to me why anyone plays Ruy Lopez?  (I&#39;m serious, not being rhetorical.)  It seems so pointless, because white is wasting two tempos if not three to no good purpose after Morphy&#39;s defense.  It only serves a purpose if white&#39;s intent is to trade the bishop for the knight, which is harmful in the long run; I never see anyone make this trade, so why did they play Ruy Lopez in the first place?<br><br>I personally play Ruy Lopez against Stockfish (Lichess level 5) whenever the opportunity presents itself, but I have a special reason.  The engine&#39;s knight-play is its strongest weapon, absolutely devastating, and I have no hope of even drawing unless I can take off both black knights within the first ten moves.  If I do take off both knights early on, I pretty much have a 50/50 chance of avoiding a defeat and a 20% chance of a win.  The other black knight has to be traded off with a white knight, or my lack of bishops will cramp me in the middle game and crush me in the end game.  My preference is to force black to trade both of its knights for my white knights, but it doesn&#39;t always cooperate so if an opportunity to use Ruy Lopez and take the pinned knight with the bishop arises, I take it.  If I do, one of my remaining knights is designated to trade itself with a black knight ASAP, and the other white knight is assigned to trade itself off against a black bishop (it doesn&#39;t matter which one) so that I don&#39;t play the rest of the game down a knight to a bishop, which would kill me in the end.<br><br>Of course I would not use this strategy against a human.\u0003@Elohim Keithrafferty Thanks for your careful explanation, I will study it and the linked video.\u0003Morphy was clearly ill the first two games, his play was pedestrian.  Not to minimize Anderssen&#39;s brilliant play those games, but Morphy failed to see threats or to deal with them.  This game he played flawlessly; nothing brilliant, but he saw and dealt perfectly with all of the threats, and he didn&#39;t miss his own attacking possibilities.  Not really a great game in the sense of both players playing well; first Anderssen blundered away his own queen and his attack collapsed, and then he trapped his own bishop in the corner.  (Oddly, Morphy permitted it to escape -- I don&#39;t understand why.)\u0003It was still primitive even in the 1890s.\u0003He certainly wasn&#39;t at his best.\u0003Evans gambit is only good against people unfamiliar with it.\u0003But also that Andersen knew how to beat the Evans gambit.\u0003How about Harwitz vs Stanton?  A game of liar&#39;s poker, in which they both should excel.\u0003Duke Charles didn&#39;t make any blunders, but Morphy attacked so quickly and ferociously that the duke was effectively playing down a rook and bishop while Morphy himself had all his pieces involved.  He was then free to make sacrifices to isolate Black&#39;s king since he was effectively playing up a rook and a bishop.\u0003@Dr. Bluesfield Oh, I must have misread it.

He thought with perfect play, it will be a draw by repition but if he misses my knight idea this young buck is mine.\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgYeBGkM4Ng&amp;t=13m16s\">13:16</a> is truly a disgusting Anand line.

The lens projects an image onto the frosted glass that can be focused by lengthening/shortening the bellows. Such a camera weighs about 20 lbs. From behind the camera you view the projection onto the frosted glass with a black cloth over your head to block out outside light, as the projected image is quite dim. You reposition the camera to get your desired framing, then move the lens fore/aft to bring it into focus, and put on the lens cap. This could take a while to get just right, afterward the camera is then ready to take a picture upon being loaded with a single sheet of film. <br><br>The &quot;film&quot; was a sheet of glass, coated on location with a light sensitive colloidal liquid in a perfectly dark enclosure set up for that purpose (outside in nature, often a black tent). You mixed the colloid, coating the glass sheet with the light sensitive colloid in complete darkness, then installed it into a light-tight wooden &quot;holder&quot; or frame with a removable cover sheet. You then bring the holder with glass inside to the camera, &amp; swap out the frosted focusing glass at the back of the camera for it, where it rests at the exact position onto which the image had been focused. You now have a loaded camera ready to expose film. <br><br>To expose the film installed in the camera you first slide away the cover sheet (the &quot;dark slide&quot;) from the glass sheet holder (the side that faces toward the lens). Using a watch, you then remove the lens cap allowing light through the lens just as when you focused (cameras this old did not have shutters), thus exposing the film for a known time, then replace the cap. You reinsert the dark slide to make the glass sheet safe from light, and may then repeat the process with another holder of film. You probably developed the film in a chemical bath before leaving, to make sure you got a usable image.<br><br>PS this clunky process gets fantastic results of far higher quality in many ways than what you can achieve today, unless you use the same processes.\u0003@Violamanben - Your petty disconnected crits are tedious, and you are not a good writer of what little you know. You don&#39;t understand film and NO it was not orthochromatic (which is very uncool btw), that is nonsense. Why do you suppose you need to load in the dark? Enough out of you!\u0003@Violamanben - A list of what I did not include is petty whining, as I got a certain message across, in a certain reasonable length. I was not writing a Wikipedia page, this is a simple forum. The images as you must know were contact printed. You seem to not be able to figure out if you want to criticize or toot your own horn. PS Potassium Ferrocyanide is not fixer.\u0003@Veavictis Asmadi - Those portraits are probably &quot;contact prints&quot; made with the glass neg simply laid down on photo paper. It&#39;s all about negative size, when I scan film that is only 2x3inches, I get 300 megabyte files or more using 16 bit. An 8x10 inch neg has so much data gathering ability it exceeds that of the lens.\u0003@jayteegamble - Today you use film instead of glass, but otherwise you can use the same setup.

In the beginning, you should try to dominate the center, develop your minor pieces, castle and connect your rooks. That should happen roughly within the first twelve or so moves, and usually once a player has achieved that, the opening is completed and the mid-game starts.<br>Many opening-lines have been played over the centuries, and the most successful openings have prevailed. The best chess players know many patterns and positions and their continuations by heart, so the idea in high level chess is mainly to get to a position where your opponent has to start guessing what&#39;s best to do.<br>Therefore, high-level-players start out with known opening patterns because they know they are really strong, but then try to find a new continuation to surprise an opponent.<br>That&#39;s why the completely new games usually start between moves six and twelve, when opening-theory is exhausted. That&#39;s when chess players can show what they&#39;re really made of, when they&#39;ve run out of preparation and have to find moves over the board!.\u0003Dubov&#39;s creativity borders on recklessness.

Thanks for the clarification.\u0003@The Elvis Not sure I follow. The Queen on C2 is in front of the king. So there&#39;s no check when re capturing on C5.\u0003@Raymond Reddington Let me show you. I just played this out with a friend who is close to 2100.<br><br>1.Rd2 a4<br>2. Rxc3+ exc3<br>3. Kd1 a3! (Notice you can&#39;t stop me from pushing this to a2 where it is protected by my bishop)<br>4. Kc1 a2!<br>5. Kb2 in hopes of freeing up your bishop so it doesn&#39;t have to waste moves to get control of the a1-h8 diagonal.. I play h5 putting all my pawns in light squares<br><br>6. Bf4 or anywhere along that diagonal, Ke4!<br><br>7. Be3, Kf3 trying to get to ke2 and then it really is game over.<br><br>To prevent that, you&#39;d have to play 6. f3 but then I have Be3.<br><br>You can&#39;t Kxb3 because a1 = Q.<br><br>7. h4 because you don&#39;t have a single good move here.. Kc4<br><br>8. If g4, then a1 = Q+ , Kxa1 and Kc3. You&#39;re not stopping d2 at this point. White will have to give up the bishop. So g4  loses.<br><br>8. Instead of g4, you can play Bd2 but I play Kd4 (or even Kxc5 and there goes your c pawn lol! and you still can&#39;t play Kxb3 due to a1=Q)<br><br>9. Bc3+ (taking control of a1 in the process), Ke3!! <br><br>And you still can&#39;t play Kxb3 because a1 = Q, Bxa1, d2 and you&#39;re not stopping d1 = Q.<br><br>So 9. Bc3+ loses as well. What else?<br><br>9. Ka1.. Kxc5!! and there goes the c pawn and now black does have 2 connected pawns. So let&#39;s go back<br><br>9. Bg5, Kxc5!.. Ok let&#39;s try again. <br><br>9. Bb4 protecting c5 and keeping an eye on d2.. Ke3 and white can&#39;t stop d2.<br><br>Do you realize now why black is winning?<br><br>Black&#39;s b pawn along with the much advanced a pawn is what makes this winning and not a draw. The b pawn is why white simply can&#39;t afford to give up c5 until he has to. Your logic is a1 is a dark square therefore draw. <br><br>I see 2 connected passed pawns, an advanced d pawn and a much more active king that is cutting off the white bishop from immediately taking control of the a1-h8 diagonal.<br><br>If you&#39;re still not convinced, then play this against the computer and see if you can draw this. Or against a strong player\u0003He didn&#39;t resign because he was a pussy. He resigned because one of those Queenside pawns is going to Queen and white simply cannot stop it. The best he can do is make that difficult for black\u0003Let&#39;s see. So you&#39;re suggesting Bxd5 instead of f5 right?<br><br>1. Ra1 Bxd5<br>2. exd5 Nb4?<br>3. Rxa3 Nxc2<br>4. Ra2 or Rc3 I don&#39;t know if I matters.<br><br>And I don&#39;t see how the black knight is getting out. It looks like white will two pieces for a rook while having two connected passed pawns on c5 and d5.\u0003Or white can give up the rook for two pieces. The engine evaluates this as a winning advantage. I don&#39;t see how giving up two pieces for a rook in this positions gives black any advantage.<br><br>White can move the king too to avoid the fork. But f5 doesn&#39;t work now because the bishop is on g4 and thus is not attacking the knight on d5 (which was why f5 was strong in the first place). So white can simply move the f3 knight somewhere else.\u0003Probably because white doesn&#39;t have to capture the Bishop immediately. He can simply move the king as the knight is protected by the g2 pawn. Haven&#39;t analyzed that position yet so this is just my initial observation.\u0003@Douglas Foley You&#39;re overlooking something really simple. Mistakes happen but you don&#39;t intentionally play a move that worsens your position (in this case, Bg4). Black is worse off no matter what white does. White can just move the king and take your bishop. Or he can just give up his rook for two minor pieces and get a solid position.<br><br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t played&quot; <br><br> My point is that there&#39;s a reason it wasn&#39;t played. Because it isn&#39;t a good move and if a simple 1700 player like me can see that, no wonder the world champion did.\u0003I just analyzed some possibilities and f5 is indeed the only move that doesn&#39;t ruin Black&#39;s position. <br><br>Bg4 doesn&#39;t work because white can indeed gladly give up the rook for two pieces. No way for black to get any kind of advantage here. The best he can hope is for white to blunder in some way. Not how you want to play chess lol. <br><br>Or white can simply move the king to avoid the fork and the black bishop is still trapped.<br><br>Generally, you don&#39;t give up two minor pieces for a rook unless it helps your position in some way. <br><br>Here, f5 allows black to keep material equal which is the best approach.\u0003Haven&#39;t analyzed the possibilities yet but that dark square Bishop isn&#39;t going anywhere. So if black plays Bg3 instead of f5, white doesn&#39;t have to rush. White king could just move so the knight couldn&#39;t check and then what? Black would have to settle for 2 pawns for a Bishop if I&#39;m not wrong.\u0003Because it will leave black a full piece down. Why would you simply want to be up an exchange when you can be a full piece up?<br><br>But here there&#39;s another problem. If you go for the exchange, black will first capture on f3 with check and only then recapture on a8 ending up with two pieces for a rook. You don&#39;t want to give up two pieces for a rook unless it helps your position in some way.\u0003"]], ["Avinash Kadam", [11, "Anderson : I don&#39;t want to play with u  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Good Morning \ud83d\ude02... from India \ud83e\udd17\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFvjytywYvA&amp;t=22m08s\">22:08</a> India\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd17\u0003<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI3wwT3cWgE&amp;t=11m26s\">11:26</a> Game Starts \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude02\u0003Yesterday I saw People saying Magnus  not worthy of champion &amp; not better than Bobby, as he lost to Duda but I said Nope he is GOAT.....!!<br><br>Yes he can Squeeze water from Stone...!!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\u0003He is Gone....!!\ud83d\ude34\u0003\ud83d\ude32\u0003It&#39;s not &quot;Santosh Gujrathi Vidit&quot;...

While you can call it the greatest match of the 19th century, one could argue Steinitz vs Zukertort (1886) is right up there - it&#39;s a cracking match! Agad should cover it one of these days. The last hurrah for the century was of course Steinitz vs Lasker (1894). We shall never know how Morphy would deal with Steinitz. I consider this the greatest match that never was. It&#39;s amazing to think that Lasker played against Henry Bird (who played vs Morphy). Lasker also played Botvinnik (who played vs Fischer).The book I have has the moves wrong. In &quot;The Chess Games of Adolph Anderssen - Master of Attack&quot; (1996 isbn 1-886846-03-0) it shows Morphy&#39;s 40th move as 40... Re7 instead of 40... Kh7. It&#39;s no little thing either. As Agad points out, this is a crucial part of the game!<br>edit: The move order from move 40 according to the Anderssen book: 40.Kg3 Re7 41. Kf4 Kh7 42. Kg3 Re3 43. Kf4 Re8 44. Kg3 Re3 drawn.\u0003Anderssen had to be the best player in the world following the great 1851 Tournament. Some commentators place him as an unofficial world champion based on metrics, until the Morphy period came along of course. After Morphy&#39;s early retirement he resumed his dominance more or less before Steintz. Anderssen is worthy of a saga in his own right. I expect that will happen one day on this channel somewhere down the road.\u0003Staunton made enormous contributions to modern chess, but your eyes are continually drawn to the yellow stain. The chessmen before Staunton were stick-like and indistinguishingly bulbous. His Handbook of Chess was the first thorough guide of the game and was reprinted continually right into the early 20th century. Staunton&#39;s organization of tournaments put chess under a special aegis of &quot;sport&quot; for the first time. Yet, his blustery arrogance, of which there is little denial from chess contemporaries, leaves a taint on this great legacy. Add in the Morphy controversy and what is Staunton left with? As for his play, I sampled several of his games at random and there&#39;s really little there that you can call outstanding. I will say this. His positional play somewhat anticipates the principles of Steinitz. It&#39;s fair to say Staunton&#39;s style was a prototype of which Steinitz expanded and made an actual school out of. So yeah, my assessment of Staunton is forever mixed because of the match with Morphy that never was.\u0003Amazing ending - Carlsen pulled out so many tricks and traps. Duda sidestepped the worst of them, but at one point nearly threw away the win. Magnus missed his own chance to gain an upper hand. What a game though with such pressure. Magnus stormed out of the arena in disgust, but he really nothing to be ashamed of. The world champion wasn&#39;t defeated by a singular bad blunder. It just wasn&#39;t his day. The day belonged to Duda and that happens in chess.\u0003A mini rematch of 2016 with Magnus? That would be great.\u0003Am I watching the Olympics? Nope.

There were drawing chances for Pragg, but that Bf4 move by white opened a huge advantage. Another game of note was Nils Grandelius as black versus Jeffery Xiong. Grandelius made a terrible blunder and after Xiong exposed it, Xiong rose from the table for a kibitz and a stretch. During that time, the camera remained on Grandelius and it was the greatest sight of chess frustration you&#39;ve ever seen. The range of emotions he was trying to suppress was dramatic.
